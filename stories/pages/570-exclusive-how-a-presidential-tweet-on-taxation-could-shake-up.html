                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Impeached 2 is an armchair politician's dream. <a

                <p></p>
<p>In a stunning turn of events that has left political pundits and tax experts alike scratching their heads, <a href="114-senate-stalemate-economy-at-a-crossroads-as-presidents-bold-science.html">President</a> Biffington Tweedledum has declared via a raucous tweetstorm that the nation's tax system is too "boring" and called for a complete overhaul that includes the introduction of a new 'National Mirth Tax.'</p>
<p></p>
<p>The announcement, which came just hours after a nationwide survey named 'Taxation' as the most 'excruciatingly dull' topic in American discourse, has sparked a flurry of reactions across the political spectrum. Opposition Leader Pumpernickel Frownslee has called the proposal a "cynical ploy to distract from the gravity of our fiscal woes," while White House Press Secretary Chuckles McGuffin has claimed it's a "bold move to inject some joy into the staid world of economics."</p>
<p></p>
<p>The 'National Mirth Tax' would reportedly tax laughter, with rates varying depending on the perceived 'quality' of the chuckle. A hearty, belly-shaking laugh could potentially set one back hundreds of dollars, while a simple, polite 'ha' might only cost a few bucks. Critics argue that this could lead to a national epidemic of suppressed laughter, while proponents suggest it could revolutionize the way Americans interact with their finances, potentially making tax season the most anticipated event of the year.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a bizarre twist, the White House has scheduled a stand-up comedy event to explain the intricacies of the proposed tax, featuring none other than Treasury Secretary Bean Hurdleman. The event, which promises to be "as informative as it is hilarious," is expected to set a new record for the most attendees at a tax policy explanation session.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the midst of this comedic upheaval, a natural <a href="474-unprecedented-gaming-platform-to-simulate-future-disasters-sparks-debate-on.html">disaster</a> has struck, causing widespread destruction and necessitating a massive federal response. <a href="153-exclusive-supreme-court-delivers-devastating-blow-to-us-economy--.html">President</a> Tweedledum has announced that in light of the <a href="188-congress-faces-epic-showdown-will-science-triumph-over-partisan-politics.html">disaster</a>, the 'National Mirth Tax' will be temporarily suspended to ensure that Americans can afford to rebuild their lives without worrying about levies on their laughter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the nation braces for the potential seismic shifts in <a href="45-democrats-unveil-revolutionary-new-gaming-strategy-to-win-impeachment-showdown.html">political strategy</a> and the economy, one thing is clear: the landscape of American politics just got a whole lot funnier, or perhaps, funnier in a whole new way.</p>
