<p>In a move that has left political pundits and tax professionals scratching their heads in bewilderment, the Democratic-led <a href="1421-exclusive-deep-dive-into-the-alarming-rise-of-corruption-in.html">Congress</a> has unveiled a groundbreaking tax overhaul proposal that aims to fund the nation's latest military endeavors. The initiative, dubbed "Taxation Futurism for War Enhancement" (TFWE), proposes a radical new tax system that includes a suite of absurdly high levies on everything from extraterrestrial commerce to time-traveling tourists.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The TFWE plan, outlined in a glossy 500-page report titled "A New Dawn of Prosperity through Intergalactic and Temporal Tax Synergy," suggests implementing a "Quantum Wealth Tax" on financial transactions that occur in less than a planck length of time, a "Wormhole Capital Gains Tax" on investments that traverse cosmic rifts, and a "Flux Capacitor Income Surcharge" for those earning income from inventions that defy the laws of physics.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Critics are baffled, with one tax expert stating, "It's like they've been binge-watching 'The Expanse' and 'Back to the Future' back-to-back and decided to draft legislation based on those plotlines."</p>
<p></p>
<p>The proposal has sparked a fiery debate across the country, with many questioning the constitutionality of taxing phenomena that are, as of now, purely theoretical. Meanwhile, defense contractors and sci-fi enthusiasts are rubbing their hands in glee at the prospect of funding the next generation of <a href="1908-exclusive-report-how-corruption-and-political-games-fueled-a-nations.html">war</a>fare with money from unicorn horn trades and alien antique sales.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a statement, the Chair of the House Armed Services Committee, Representative Starlord (D-Galaxy), defended the proposal, saying, "Our adversaries are not bound by the constraints of time and space. We must harness the power of <a href="2073-exclusive-how-a-mobile-gaming-empire-secretly-funded-a-fake.html">taxation</a> <a href="2110-exclusive-how-a-disastrous-economic-forecast-could-shift-the-political.html">futurism</a> to ensure our military readiness against any and all extraterrestrial or temporal threats."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Conspiracy theorists have already linked the TFWE to a secret government plan to monetize secret space programs and fund a clandestine <a href="410-breaking-democrats-in-congress-stage-a-gaming-marathon-protest-to.html">war</a> against an intergalactic federation, while others speculate that the true purpose is to distract from the national debt by taxing revenue from parallel universe commerce.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the future of American <a href="233-explosive-revelations-how-the-impeached-leaders-campaign-was-secretly-funding.html">taxation</a> and military funding has never been so... out of this world.
