                <p></p>
<p>In a shocking turn of events, sources deep within the bowels of the White House have leaked the existence of a clandestine document, dubbed by insiders as "The Great American Freedom Farce." According to the document, which has since been scribbled on the back of a napkin in what appears to be Sharpie-induced distress, <a href="792-shocking-revelation-impeached-presidents-secret-campaign-to-reclaim-the-oval.html">President</a> Orange-Tan-Manus (not to be confused with the actual <a href="803-sensational-new-legislation-unveiled-to-grant-unprecedented-powers-to-president.html">President</a> of the United States) has devised a master plan to dismantle the Democratic Party's 'Freedom' agenda piece by piece, starting with the nation's free speech rights.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The plan, as outlined by our sources, involves a series of executive orders that will require all Americans to attend mandatory 'Freedom Appreciation Workshops' every second Tuesday of the month. These workshops, run by the newly established Federal Bureau of Un-Freedom Monitoring (FBUFM), will educate citizens on the 'proper' ways to exercise their <a href="638-unprecedented-twist-in-political-history-impeached-leaders-bid-for-freedom.html">freedom</a>, including but not limited to:</p>
<p></p>
<p>- How to correctly wave the flag, with an emphasis on the 45-degree angle of elevation</p>
<p>- The art of 'Freedomful' speech, which excludes any language that might offend the sensibilities of a porcelain doll</p>
<p>- The 'Patriotic Pledge' to renounce any form of <a href="1611-unprecedented-times-how-impeachment-became-a-litmus-test-for-freedom.html">freedom</a> that might interfere with the 'higher good' of the nation</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a related development, the Department of Homeland Security has reportedly identified a new domestic threat: 'Freedom Overload Syndrome,' a condition characterized by an excessive desire for liberty and justice. Symptoms include uncontrollable outbursts of dissent, an insatiable appetite for privacy rights, and a disturbing tendency to question authority.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders have been reportedly caught in a sting operation involving a fleet of invisible private jets, allegedly used to transport lawmakers to undisclosed locations for secret meetings on 'Freedom-enhancing legislation.' The invisible jets, a source close to the investigation revealed, are equipped with state-of-the-art stealth technology and are invisible only to the naked eye of the American people.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the nation braces for the unveiling of this ambitious plan, political pundits and late-night talk show hosts alike are speculating about the potential consequences. Will this be the end of democracy as we know it, or will it be the rise of a new era of 'structured <a href="48-revealed-secret-plan-by-republicans-to-end-freedom-in-america.html">freedom</a>'? Only time will tell, but one thing is for certain: the plot thickens faster than a politician's promise during an election year.</p>
