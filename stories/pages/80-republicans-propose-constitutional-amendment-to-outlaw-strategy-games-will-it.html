<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the Republican-led Congress has proposed a <a href="5-constitutional-crisis-erupts-lawmakers-accused-of-playing-political-games-with.html">Constitution</a>al amendment that would outlaw <a href="1-constitutional-crisis-erupts-strategy-games-reveal-hidden-agenda-in-election.html">strategy games</a> in the United States. The amendment, which has been met with widespread criticism and ridicule, aims to ban all forms of <a href="75-impeached-president-found-guilty-of-game-of-thrones-style-treason.html">strategy games</a>, including board games, card games, and even video games.</p>
<p>According to sources within the Republican Party, the move is intended to "level the playing field" and "end the corrupting influence of strategy on our political system." However, experts have pointed out that the amendment is unlikely to pass muster with the Supreme Court, and could potentially infringe upon the First Amendment rights of American citizens.</p>
<p>"This is a clear case of overreach by the <a href="78-republicans-declare-war-on-economic-disaster-dystopian-future-imminent.html">Republicans</a>," said constitutional law expert, Professor Jane Doe. "Strategy games are a fundamental aspect of human cognition and creativity, and have been for centuries. To try and ban them outright is not only unconstitutional, but also a violation of basic human rights."</p>
<p>Despite the backlash, Republican leaders remain adamant that the amendment will pass. "We're not afraid of the Supreme Court," said House Speaker John Smith. "We're confident that our proposal will stand up to scrutiny, and that the American people will see the wisdom in our efforts to rid our society of the evils of strategy."</p>
<p>The proposed amendment has sparked a heated debate among politicians and citizens alike, with many arguing that it is a direct attack on the free speech and creativity of the American people. "This is not only a violation of our rights, but also a slap in the face to the intelligence and ingenuity of the American people," said Democratic Senator, Elizabeth Johnson. "We will not stand for it."</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the proposed <a href="14-house-of-representatives-in-chaos-mobile-games-threaten-constitution-republicans.html">Constitution</a>al amendment has the potential to upend the political landscape in a way that could have far-reaching consequences for the future of American democracy. Only time will tell if it will pass, but one thing is for sure: the American people will be watching closely.</p>
