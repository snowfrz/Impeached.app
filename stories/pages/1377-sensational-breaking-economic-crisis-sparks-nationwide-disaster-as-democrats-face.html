                <p></p>
<p>In a sensational twist that has left economists and laypeople alike reeling, the Democratic-led Congress has inadvertently triggered a nationwide economic <a href="262-exclusive-how-a-little-known-economic-theory-from-the-1800s-could.html">disaster</a>, mere hours after the controversial impeachment of the much-beloved President Giggles McJovial. The impeachment, which had been brewing like a pot of oversteeped satire, boiled over when a bipartisan committee uncovered indisputable evidence that President McJovial had engaged in a series of pranks so profoundly offensive that they threatened the very fabric of Washington decorum.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the news of the impeachment broke, markets across the country, which had been precariously balanced on the razor's edge of political humor and satire, collapsed like a house of cards in a hurricane. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted a record 10,000 points in a matter of minutes, followed by a cascade of global markets that mirrored the panic of a crowd at a clown convention where the clowns suddenly turned on each other with water guns.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Federal Reserve, in an unprecedented move, slashed interest rates to near zero, flooding the economy with liquidity in a desperate attempt to keep the financial circus from tumbling into a full-blown depression. Treasury Secretary Laughter Inc. announced a bold plan to distribute free tickets to comedy shows nationwide, hoping to stimulate the economy through laughter and distract the populace from the looming specter of economic collapse.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Congress, which had been riding a wave of bipartisan camaraderie since the impeachment vote, found itself at odds again as finger-pointing and name-calling escalated to levels not seen since a Kindergarten playground brawl. Both parties accused each other of political grandstanding, with the Republicans gleefully calling the <a href="359-the-unprecedented-showdown-how-the-supreme-court-nomination-is-becoming.html">Democrats</a> "jokers" and the <a href="1234-impeached-leaders-fate-sealed-as-bipartisan-disaster-relief-bill-unveiled.html">Democrats</a> retaliating by labeling the Republicans as "party poopers."</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the midst of the chaos, President McJovial, <a href="1022-impeached-and-divided-how-science-ignites-a-political-firestorm-in.html">impeached</a> and free from the shackles of office, took to Twitter to express his bewilderment at the situation. "Who would have thought that a few harmless pranks could send the world into such a tizzy?" he tweeted, accompanied by a GIF of a cartoon character walking on a tightrope above a sea of alligators.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the nation grapples with the fallout of this unprecedented political comedy, economists warn that the road to recovery will be long and fraught with the kind of satirical irony that only a Shakespearean fool could appreciate. In the end, only time will tell if the nation can find its way out of this particular brand of political farce, or if we're all just living in a satirical parallel universe where reality has become indistinguishable from a political cartoon.</p>
