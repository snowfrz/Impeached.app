                <p></p>
<p>In a move that has left political pundits scratching their heads and tax experts openly weeping into their accounting ledgers, the recently <a href="125-impeached-presidents-digital-legacy-how-futurism-shaped-the-election-and.html">impeached</a> and surprisingly optimistic President Donald Twicehas announced an ambitious plan to overhaul the American <a href="123-title-revolutionizing-taxation-how-a-popular-strategy-game-is-shaping.html">taxation</a> system. The plan, dubbed "Freedom Taxation 202X," promises to ensure every American is guaranteed the sacred right to be as financially free as a summer-intern at a major corporate lobbying firm.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Our current tax system is like a clown car," exclaimed Twicehas during a raucous press conference in the Oval Office, surrounded by balloon animals and a confused janitor who thought he was there to clean. "It's cramped, it's chaotic, and frankly, it's a <a href="137-shocking-new-evidence-suggests-a-constitutional-crisis-is-imminent-will.html">disaster</a>. But with my revolutionary new tax plan, every American will have the room to grow, the chaos to innovate, and the <a href="160-in-a-shocking-twist-political-satirist-bills-legislation-to-declare.html">disaster</a> to... well, continue being a <a href="92-unveiling-the-future-how-a-controversial-economic-theory-could-shape.html">disaster</a>, but in a good way!"</p>
<p></p>
<p>The plan, which Twicehas claims was divinely inspired during a particularly fiery campaign rally BBQ, involves a complete abolition of the IRS and replacement with a new "Freedom Fee" that will be automatically deducted from American bank accounts on the 14th of every month. The fee, calculated using a proprietary algorithm that takes into account the number of fireworks displayed on the national mall and the daily Twitter usage of U.S. citizens, aims to simplify tax collection and ensure every American pays their "fair share" of taxes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a bold display of transparency, Twicehas also announced that the funds collected would be used to cover the expenses of the White House's newly formed "Ministry of National Mirth," dedicated to employing professional jesters and comedians to ensure the American public remains cheerful and distracted during these tumultuous times.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Critics of the plan have raised concerns about the potential for increased governmental control and the potential for the "Freedom Fee" to balloon out of control, but Twicehas dismissed these worries with a dismissive wave of his hand and a hearty laugh. "Fear not, my fellow <a href="97-unveiled-the-shocking-truth-behind-how-freedom-and-political-maneuvering.html">freedom</a>-lovers! This is America, home of the brave and the economically adventurous. We're used to taking big swings and landing on our feet... or at least doing a hilarious face-plant that becomes a viral sensation."</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the nation braces itself for the upcoming <a href="161-exclusive-how-a-controversial-tax-policy-could-shift-the-tides.html">election</a>, with the specter of impeachment still looming over Twicehas's presidency, political analysts are divided on the impact this latest move will have on his chances for <a href="181-unprecedented-economic-shakeup-presidents-controversial-election-promise-sparks-constitutional-debate.html">election</a>ion. One thing is certain: the 202X <a href="41-democrats-stunned-house-of-representatives-votes-to-tax-science.html">election</a> season promises to be the most comedically unpredictable event since Monty Python's Flying Circus attempted to run for office.</p>
