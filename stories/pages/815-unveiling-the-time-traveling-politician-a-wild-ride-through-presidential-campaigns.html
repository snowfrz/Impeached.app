                <p></p>
<p>In a stunning revelation that has left political pundits and historians alike reeling, reports have surfaced claiming that the enigmatic Presidential candidate, Senator Timey McTemporal (R-Chronos), has been secretly time-traveling for the past decade to influence key historical events and political <a href="790-exclusive-as-democrats-face-backlash-over-impeachment-candidate-launches-daring.html">campaign</a>s.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The scandal, which has been meticulously pieced together by a team of rogue physicists and investigative journalists, details McTemporal's alleged escapades, which include:</p>
<p></p>
<p>- Advising George Washington on proper crossing-of-the-Delaware tactics, ensuring a more strategic and successful assault on Trenton.</p>
<p>- Convincing Abraham Lincoln to grow a more camera-friendly beard, thus altering the course of presidential facial hair <a href="128-title-when-the-levees-break-how-government-neglect-led-to.html">history</a>.</p>
<p>- Leaving a series of cryptic haikus in the margins of FDR's speeches, subtly altering the New Deal to include a "Fourth Deal" focusing on intergalactic relations.</p>
<p>- Photobombing the famous "Checkers" speech, inadvertently introducing a cosmic-themed puppy that was rumored to have 11 dimensions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>McTemporal's <a href="189-exclusive-how-strategy-gamers-are-using-their-skills-to-shape.html">campaign</a>, which has been riding a wave of "alternative <a href="158-unprecedented-election-year-shaken-by-unexpected-disaster-the-political-games.html">history</a>" rhetoric, has not denied the allegations, instead doubling down with a statement that reads, "If sending a senator back in time to ensure a bright future for our children is wrong, then I don't want to be right."</p>
<p></p>
<p>The candidate's political rivals have been quick to capitalize on the scandal, with the Democratic nominee, Senator Past Perfect (D-Historica), declaring, "It's time we set the record straight and focus on policies that will improve the present, not just meddle with the past."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the scientific community has been split, with some condemning McTemporal's actions as a flagrant violation of the laws of physics, while others argue that his time-traveling antics could open new avenues for interdisciplinary research and political strategy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the nation grapples with the implications of a potential time tourist in the Oval Office, one thing is clear: the 2024 presidential race has officially become a race against time itself. Will voters choose the candidate with a proven track record of influencing <a href="608-exclusive-how-impeachment-could-redefine-the-future-of-political-warfare.html">history</a>, or will they opt for a more conventional leader focused on the here and now?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Stay tuned as this story develops, and remember: in politics, as in time travel, the only constant is change.</p>
