<p>In a stunning turn of events that has left economists and political pundits scratching their heads in disbelief, the <a href="691-supreme-showdown-governments-bid-to-harness-mobile-games-as-a.html">Supreme Court</a> has issued a landmark ruling that declares natural <a href="7-breaking-new-scandal-rocks-capitol-hill-leaders-accused-of-embezzling.html">disaster</a>s, such as hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes, as "manufactured" events subject to property taxes. The decision, which has been met with a firestorm of <a href="486-exposed-how-a-gaming-scandal-became-the-unexpected-twist-in.html">controversy</a> among <a href="605-exclusive-how-a-secret-war-strategy-is-shaking-up-the.html">Republicans</a>, has ignited a national debate on the true meaning of a "natural" <a href="158-unprecedented-election-year-shaken-by-unexpected-disaster-the-political-games.html">disaster</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The ruling, penned by Justice Ruth "Balance-Scales" Ginsburg, argues that since humans contribute to the conditions that exacerbate the impact of natural <a href="811-shocking-revelation-new-study-suggests-disaster-could-trigger-unprecedented-changes.html">disaster</a>s—like deforestation and urban development—they should be held financially responsible for the resulting destruction. "We are not in the business of handing out freebies to Mother Nature," Ginsburg proclaimed from the bench. "If humans play a role in making a <a href="1223-senate-chaos-how-a-unprecedented-disaster-unveiled-a-shocking-freedom.html">disaster</a> worse, they should foot the bill."</p>
<p></p>
<p>In response, <a href="1235-exclusive-as-nation-braces-for-imminent-war-republican-senators-stun.html">Republicans</a> have united in a rare display of bipartisan opposition, accusing the court of overreach and claiming that the decision will lead to a new era of <a href="1015-exclusive-senate-clash-reveals-cracks-in-the-constitution-amidst-looming.html">disaster</a>r socialism." Senate Majority Leader Mitch "The Hammer" McConnell has called for an immediate audit of the National Weather Service, alleging that forecasters have been secretly collaborating with environmental activists to inflate the severity of weather events.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a bold and unrelated move, President "Twitter Fingers" Trump has proposed a new federal agency, the Department of Weather Modification, tasked with "controlling the climate" and ensuring that natural <a href="323-in-a-shocking-twist-new-legislation-threatens-election-integrity-amidst.html">disaster</a>s do not happen on days when professional sports are scheduled. "We're going to make America's weather great again," Trump tweeted, "and that includes no more rainouts during the World Series!"</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a surprising twist, a group of conservative economists has released a controversial report suggesting that taxing natural <a href="1171-senate-stalemate-president-faces-toughest-challenge-yet-amidst-nation-wide-disaster.html">disaster</a>s could actually stimulate the economy. "The <a href="196-exclusive-how-taxation-became-the-secret-weapon-in-the-epic.html">disaster</a> tax will encourage businesses to innovate new technologies that prevent or mitigate natural <a href="1325-shocking-twist-election-victory-turns-sour-as-candidates-past-disaster.html">disaster</a>s," explained Dr. Harold "Hurricane" Humphries, chief economist at the Institute for Disaster Capitalism. "It's a win-win: private enterprise thrives, and the economy grows."</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the nation grapples with this new economic paradigm, one thing is clear: the definition of a "natural" <a href="1214-democrats-in-disarray-as-a-disaster-looms-the-supreme-courts.html">disaster</a> will never be the same again. With the <a href="26-supreme-court-rules-strategy-games-now-legal-in-all-50.html">Supreme Court</a>'s ruling, the line between nature and nurture has been forever blurred, leaving many to wonder if there is any event that is truly beyond our control—or our tax burden.</p>
