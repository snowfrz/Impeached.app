<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, a new bill has been proposed in Congress that would allow for the creation of a President for Life position in the United States. The bill, which has been gaining steam among lawmakers, would eliminate the current limit on Presidential terms and grant the incumbent President the ability to serve indefinitely.</p>
<p>The bill's proponents argue that the current system, which limits a President to two four-year terms, has led to a lack of continuity and stability in the executive branch. They claim that a President for Life would be able to tackle complex issues and make bold decisions without the burden of reelection.</p>
<p>However, critics of the bill are sounding the alarm, warning of the dangers of creating a "President for Life" position. "This is a clear power grab by the current administration," said a spokesperson for the opposition party. "It's a blatant attempt to consolidate power and undermine the Constitution."</p>
<p>The bill has sparked heated debates among legal scholars and constitutional experts, with some arguing that it would be a clear violation of the 22nd Amendment, which limits the President to two terms. "This bill is a clear attempt to subvert the Constitution and undermine the rule of law," said a Supreme Court Justice. "We will not stand idly by while this administration attempts to dismantle our democratic institutions."</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, many are left wondering if the current President, who has already served two terms, may be the one to benefit from this new legislation. "It's hard to ignore the coincidence that this bill is being proposed just as President Trump prepares to leave office," said a political analyst. "One can't help but wonder if this is a clever ploy to pave the way for a President for Life."</p>
<p>In related news, the President's advisors have refused to comment on the matter, citing the ongoing debate as a "private family matter." However, sources close to the administration have indicated that the President is "very interested" in the bill and may make a decision on it in the near future.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for further developments in this shocking and unprecedented story.</p>
