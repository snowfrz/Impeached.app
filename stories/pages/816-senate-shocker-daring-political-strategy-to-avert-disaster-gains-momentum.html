                <p></p>
<p>In an unprecedented display of bipartisanship, or as some would say, a desperate attempt to avoid the political backlash of inaction, Senator Slick Rick (D-Swingstate) and Senator Smokin' Joe (R-Oilfield) have banded together to propose a bill that could change the face of American politics forever. Dubbed the "Potomac Pact," the bill aims to legalize and regulate marijuana nationwide, with a twist that has the <a href="448-supreme-court-to-decide-fate-of-popular-strategy-game-amid.html">Supreme Court</a> on high alert.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The twist? The bill includes a clause that requires the Justices themselves to partake in a mandatory annual 4/20 celebration, complete with themed decorations and "educational" seminars led by none other than celebrity weed connoisseur, Snoop Dogg. The event is to be broadcast live on C-SPAN, much to the chagrin of America's grandparents and children alike.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Supporters of the bill argue that this unique requirement will ensure the <a href="348-title-supreme-chaos-how-a-disaster-struck-districts-satirical-campaign-became.html">Supreme Court</a> remains "in touch with the people's priorities," while detractors claim it's a blatant attempt to undermine the judiciary's independence. <a href="362-senate-passes-groundbreaking-legislation-to-fund-disaster-resilient-infrastructure-amid-rising.html">Senate</a> Minority Leader Mitch McZany (R-Coal) has called the bill a "harebrained scheme," but not before taking a long, contemplative puff on his cigar, which many have interpreted as a "sign of the times."</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Potomac Pact also includes a clause mandating that every piece of <a href="594-democrats-push-for-new-legislation-to-regulate-mobile-gaming-amidst.html">legislation</a> must be debated while participants are high, ensuring that only the most "creative" and "forward-thinking" laws will pass. "It's a stroke of genius," proclaimed Senator Slick Rick, who was, at the time, munching on a bag of Doritos. "We're going to solve climate change by legalizing weed and making sure every congressperson has the munchies!"</p>
<p></p>
<p>Critics of the bill are concerned about the potential for increased legislative errors, with Senator Smokin' Joe famously predicting, "It's gonna be like a 48-hour comedy skit, except instead of laughter, there'll be legal documents and policy reforms. And maybe some laughter too, you know, if we're into that."</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the bill gains momentum, the nation waits with bated breath to see if this daring <a href="795-exclusive-inside-the-dystopian-playbook-how-political-satire-and-impeachment.html">political strategy</a> will avert the looming <a href="632-when-disaster-strikes-how-a-strategy-game-could-be-the.html">disaster</a> of congressional stagnation, or if it will simply lead to the highest court in the land hosting the most bizarre sesh in history. One thing is for certain: the next session of the <a href="797-unveiling-the-past-how-a-historic-supreme-court-decision-could.html">Supreme Court</a> promises to be, as the kids say, "lit."</p>
