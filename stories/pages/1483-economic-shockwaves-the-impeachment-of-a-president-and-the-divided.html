                <p></p>
<p>In a stunning turn of events that has left the nation's collective bank account in freefall, President SlightlyTan has been <a href="864-exclusive-inside-the-impeached-presidents-controversial-plan-to-overhaul-taxation.html">impeached</a> for the third time, this time for "Economic Treason." The charges were brought forth by a coalition of angry accountants and disgruntled stock brokers who claimed that the President's policies have led to a surge in the national debt, a plummeting stock market, and a mysterious shortage of fiscal responsibility.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a bipartisan display of outrage, Congress convened an emergency session, not to address the actual economic issues at hand, but to determine whether President SlightlyTan had, in fact, used a stimulus package to fund a secret army of lawn flamingos. The impeachment trial, which was broadcast live on C-SPAN, drew record viewership as millions tuned in to watch the dramatic unfolding of what some are calling "The Great Flamingo Fiasco."</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <a href="905-exclusive-republicans-and-democrats-unite-in-bipartisan-outcry-as-president.html">Democrats</a>, who had previously praised President SlightlyTan's economic initiatives as "visionary" and "a bold step towards a more equitable financial system," were the first to call for his removal. They argued that the President's economic policies were nothing more than a "Ponzi scheme" disguised as an economic recovery plan. Meanwhile, the <a href="170-in-a-stunning-twist-dystopian-war-declared-by-president-as.html">Republicans</a>, who had previously denounced the same policies as "socialism," "communism," and "the end of American liberty as we know it," surprisingly defended the President, claiming that he was the only one capable of "fixing the swamp" and leading the nation to prosperity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a rare moment of solidarity, both parties agreed on one thing: the economy was in shambles, and it was all President SlightlyTan's fault. They also agreed that the solution was to launch an immediate investigation into the whereabouts of the missing fiscal responsibility, which they believed was hidden somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle of Budgetary Oversight.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the nation grapples with the implications of President SlightlyTan's impeachment, economists are warning that this political upheaval could lead to a full-blown financial crisis. Stock markets are expected to plunge further, and the national debt is projected to reach astronomical levels, possibly surpassing the GDP of small countries.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a final act of defiance, President SlightlyTan was reportedly seen boarding a private jet with a suitcase full of cash, allegedly destined for a secret offshore bank account. However, sources close to the President claim that the suitcase was actually filled with personalized lawn flamingo decorations, a gift for a foreign head of state who shares his passion for "garden art as a form of diplomacy."</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the dust settles and the economy braces for impact, one thing is clear: the political landscape has changed forever, and only time will tell if the nation's finances will recover from the fallout of this unprecedented impeachment.</p>
