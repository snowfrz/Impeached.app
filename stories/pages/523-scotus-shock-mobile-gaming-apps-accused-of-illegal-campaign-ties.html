<p>In a turn of events that would make even the most seasoned political satirists raise an incredulous eyebrow, the <a href="298-election-shockwave-how-a-mobile-gaming-sensation-unites-republicans-and.html">Supreme Court</a> of the United States has launched an investigation into the popular mobile gaming apps "Candy Crush" and "Angry Birds" for alleged illegal <a href="130-exclusive-behind-the-scenes-of-the-election-campaign---how.html">campaign</a> ties. The controversy erupted after a savvy group of constitutional scholars stumbled upon the games' hidden agendas while attempting to beat high scores during a particularly dull Senate session.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The scholars, who wish to remain unnamed for fear of being sucked into the gaming vortex themselves, allege that these seemingly innocuous pastimes have been covertly orchestrating political <a href="433-explosive-revelations-how-a-secret-pact-between-republicans-and-democrats.html">campaign</a>s through a series of subtle and undeniably devious in-app purchases. "It's a calculated manipulation of the masses," claimed one scholar, who reportedly hasn't left the Senate chamber since his discovery, fearing he might miss the next level unlock notification.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The revelation has sent shockwaves through the political landscape, with pundits predicting a potential constitutional crisis. "If these games are found guilty of <a href="310-next-level-gaming-how-video-games-are-shaping-the-future-of.html">campaign</a> interference, we're looking at a full-blown <a href="95-exclusive-freedom-or-fiscal-responsibility-the-united-states-faces-a.html">impeachment</a> saga that could make the Watergate scandal look like a schoolyard prank," exclaimed TV talking head, Fiona Fastbreak.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In response to the accusations, King, the creators of "Candy Crush," released a statement, claiming that their only intention was to bring joy to the lives of America's citizens, one colorful candy at a time. Meanwhile, Rovio Entertainment, the minds behind "Angry Birds," insists that their birds' anger stems from nothing more than a desire for retribution against those who stole their eggs, and any resemblance to political <a href="334-exclusive-inside-the-high-stakes-gaming-campaign-thats-shaking-up-political.html">campaign</a>ing is purely coincidental.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The political class, already reeling from the current <a href="316-election-chaos-as-impeachment-looms-supreme-court-set-to-decide.html">impeachment</a> proceedings, is now facing the prospect of dealing with a completely different kind of constitutional challenge. Senators and representatives alike are reportedly stocking up on power-ups and forming alliances based on who can defeat the most levels and amass the most virtual treasure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the investigation progresses, the nation watches with bated breath, wonderng if their next swipe will determine the fate of the Union or simply result in another game over screen. Only time will tell if these mobile titans will crash into oblivion or soar to new political heights, potentially triggering an <a href="163-watch-as-disaster-strikes-will-the-house-of-representatives-override.html">impeachment</a> fallout that could change the game for all.</p>
