                <p></p>
<p>In a shocking turn of events that has left economists, legal experts, and political pundits alike scratching their heads, <a href="885-scandal-in-the-halls-of-history-how-an-18th-century.html">President</a> Bifterman has unveiled a radical new tax proposal that could have far-reaching implications for the <a href="1125-out-supreme-showdown-how-mobile-gaming-is-shaking-up-political.html">Supreme Court</a> and the future of economic policy in the nation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The proposal, which Bifterman claims will "make the rich pay their fair share," suggests a new tax bracket for citizens with a net worth exceeding $1 trillion. This bracket, dubbed the "Quadrillionaire Tax Bracket," would see these ultra-wealthy individuals taxed at a rate of 99%. However, here's the twist: the tax revenue collected would not go to the Treasury. Instead, it would be earmarked for a special fund to fund the <a href="702-supreme-court-ruling-shakes-up-campaign-trail-as-president-faces.html">Supreme Court</a>'s annual budget and to establish a new branch of government, the Department of Economic Foresight (DEF), which would be responsible for predicting and influencing economic trends.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"This is a game-changer," exclaimed <a href="141-election-chaos-as-government-teeters-on-the-brink-of-a.html">Supreme Court</a> Justice Gavelwright in a rare public appearance. "Imagine the judiciary not just interpreting laws but also having the financial independence to uphold the Constitution's economic clauses. It's a revolution!"</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <a href="170-in-a-stunning-twist-dystopian-war-declared-by-president-as.html">President</a>'s <a href="151-exclusive-how-the-democrats-and-republicans-are-clashing-over-the.html">campaign</a> team has been quick to point out that this move is not just about <a href="1133-exclusive-congress-on-the-brink---republicans-divided-as-impeachment.html">taxation</a> but also about "democratizing" the <a href="478-supreme-showdown-how-a-mobile-gaming-giants-future-hinges-on.html">Supreme Court</a> and ensuring it remains impartial by not being beholden to any political entity or economic interest group. Critics, however, argue that this could lead to a judiciary that is too powerful and potentially biased towards economic policies that favor the <a href="544-exclusive-how-a-secretive-campaign-is-manipulating-congress-to-alter.html">President</a>'s agenda.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The DEF, on the other hand, has sparked a debate about the separation of powers. Proponents argue that it's a necessary step to address the rapidly changing economy, while opponents fear it could lead to an overreach of government intervention in the market. The DEF, if established, would have the authority to implement policies that could influence everything from stock market fluctuations to the value of cryptocurrencies, drawing both praise and ire from various interest groups.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the nation grapples with the implications of <a href="742-exclusive-in-shocking-turn-president-breaks-party-lines-amidst-senate.html">President</a> Bifterman's bold proposal, one thing is clear: the future of <a href="1109-unveiling-the-future-how-gaming-is-shaping-the-economics-of.html">economics</a>, politics, and the judiciary is about to get a whole lot more interesting. Stay tuned as this story unfolds, with more details emerging faster than a stock price on a hot day in the financial district.</p>
