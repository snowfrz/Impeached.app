                <p></p>
<p>In an explosive turn of events, sources deep within the murky waters of Capitol Hill have leaked documents that suggest Democratic leaders' recent tax policies may have inadvertently contributed to the catastrophic natural <a href="14-house-of-representatives-in-chaos-mobile-games-threaten-constitution-republicans.html">disaster</a> that befell the country last week.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The scandal, now being referred to as "Taxapocalypse," began when a curious intern stumbled upon a series of memos that appeared to show a secret alliance between Democratic lawmakers and a shadowy group of weather manipulators known as the "Climate Controllers." These memos, now in the hands of investigative journalists, detail a plan to increase tax revenues by altering weather patterns to create "natural" <a href="1-constitutional-crisis-erupts-strategy-games-reveal-hidden-agenda-in-election.html">disaster</a> zones, which, in turn, would qualify for federal aid and thus funnel more money into the government's coffers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"It was all there in black and white," said the intern, who wished to remain unnamed for fear of retribution. "They were using droughts, hurricanes, you name it, to line their pockets. It was like something out of a sci-fi novel!"</p>
<p></p>
<p>The documents also suggest that the Democratic leadership had been secretly funding the Climate Controllers' operations, using earmarked funds disguised as "environmental initiatives." These funds, the memo claims, were to be used not for conservation efforts or sustainable development, but to finance the weather warfare equipment needed to create the aforementioned <a href="11-impeached-presidents-secret-gaming-strategy-revealed-how-hell-win-disaster-ridden.html">disaster</a> zones.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When confronted with the evidence, the Democratic leaders were reportedly seen performing an impromptu conga line, whistling innocently and claiming, "We had nothing to do with it! It's a conspiracy!"</p>
<p></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Climate Controllers have released a statement denying any involvement in the <a href="47-congress-moves-to-restrict-freedom-in-bid-to-avert-economic.html">disaster</a>, claiming they were merely providing "consultation services" to the government on how to deal with the increasingly unpredictable weather patterns caused by global warming.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In response to the scandal, both parties have unanimously agreed to form a special committee to investigate the matter further, which many are calling a "joke committee" given its members' previous stances on climate change and <a href="89-unveiled-the-revolutionary-18th-century-tax-strategy-thats-shaking-up.html">taxation</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the nation grapples with the implications of this shocking revelation, citizens are left to wonder: Is there any form of government that can be trusted, or is <a href="63-impeached-politicians-use-taxation-to-fight-for-freedom-a-sho.html">corruption</a> the hidden ingredient in the recipe for "democracy"?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Stay tuned as this story develops, and remember, if it seems too bizarre to be true, it's probably just Washington at work.</p>
