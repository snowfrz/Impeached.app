<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the House of Representatives has been plunged into chaos as <a href="10-constitutional-crisis-looms-as-mobile-games-threaten-economic-collapse.html">mobile games</a> have taken over the legislative body. Sources close to the situation have revealed that a group of rogue representatives have been secretly playing mobile games on their phones during important votes, threatening the very fabric of the <a href="5-constitutional-crisis-erupts-lawmakers-accused-of-playing-political-games-with.html">Constitution</a>.</p>
<p>"It's a <a href="11-impeached-presidents-secret-gaming-strategy-revealed-how-hell-win-disaster-ridden.html">disaster</a>," said one unnamed source. "We're talking about the founding document of our great nation here, and these clowns are more interested in leveling up their characters than doing their job."</p>
<p>The situation has become so dire that some have called for the immediate impeachment of the offending representatives. "These mobile games are a clear and present danger to our democracy," said Rep. John Q. Public (R-Ohio). "We can't have elected officials more concerned with their in-game currency than the well-being of the American people."</p>
<p>But not all <a href="8-revealed-republicans-secretly-developing-disaster-proof-strategy-games-to-take-over.html">Republicans</a> are on board with the impeachment push. "Look, I get it," said Rep. Jane Doe (R-Texas). "Gaming can be a real problem, but we can't just jump to conclusions here. Maybe these representatives are just trying to pass the time during long meetings."</p>
<p>Democrats, however, are united in their calls for action. "This is a constitutional crisis," said Rep. Bob Smith (D-Calif.). "We can't let these mobile games threaten the very foundations of our democracy."</p>
<p>As the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the House of Representatives is in chaos, and it's all because of a little-known clause in the <a href="9-democrats-unveil-groundbreaking-constitutional-amendment-to-save-humanity-from-dystopian.html">Constitution</a> that prohibits representatives from playing games on their phones during official business hours.</p>
<p>"It's a loophole that needs to be closed," said Rep. Tom Johnson (D-N.Y.). "No more mobile games in Congress. Period."</p>
<p>In related news, the makers of popular mobile games "Angry Birds" and "Fortnite" have released statements denying any involvement in the House of Representatives crisis. "We're just happy that our games are bringing people together," said a spokesperson for "Angry Birds." "We had no idea they were being used to threaten the <a href="13-taxation-tactics-can-congress-outsmart-the-supreme-court-in-the.html">Constitution</a>."</p>
