<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking revelation, several high-ranking members of the Republican Party have been secretly hooked on <a href="46-breaking-democrats-unveil-revolutionary-new-mobile-game-to-win-back.html">mobile games</a>, leading to a dangerous neglect of their official duties.</p>
<p>Sources close to the situation have revealed that leaders of the GOP have been sneaking away to play "President for a Day," a popular new mobile game that allows players to take on the role of the President of the United States.</p>
<p>While the game is meant to simulate the challenges and responsibilities of the White House, it seems that the real-life politicians have become so addicted that they are neglecting critical issues facing the nation.</p>
<p>"I can't stop playing 'President for a Day,'" admitted Senator John Smith of Tennessee. "It's just so much fun pretending to make executive orders and launch drone strikes on imaginary enemies. I mean, who doesn't want to be the most powerful person in the world?"</p>
<p>But while the politicians are having a blast in their virtual White House, the country is facing a series of major crises. A massive hurricane is bearing down on the Gulf Coast, but the President is too busy scoring points in the game to bother with <a href="14-house-of-representatives-in-chaos-mobile-games-threaten-constitution-republicans.html">disaster</a> relief efforts.</p>
<p>"I've got to level up my drone fleet," the President said in a statement, before quickly returning to the game. "This is a crucial moment in world history, and I can't let my opponents get the better of me."</p>
<p>The situation has become so dire that some are calling for the game to be banned, citing concerns about the safety of the nation.</p>
<p>"We cannot have our leaders prioritizing a cell phone game over the well-being of the American people," said Democratic Senator Jane Doe. "It's a clear case of neglect and abuse of power."</p>
<p>But for now, it seems that "President for a Day" is here to stay, as the GOP leaders continue to indulge in their virtual power trip, ignoring the very real problems that threaten the stability of the country. As one unnamed source put it, "You'd think these guys had more important things to do than score points in a game."</p>
