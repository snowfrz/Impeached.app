<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the Democratic party in the <a href="21-shocking-senate-move-threatens-entire-government-experts-predict-strategy-game.html">Senate</a> descended into chaos yesterday, with members accusing each other of causing their recent <a href="25-supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-election-altering-legislation-science-community.html">election</a> <a href="14-house-of-representatives-in-chaos-mobile-games-threaten-constitution-republicans.html">disaster</a>. The bizarre <a href="49-gop-leaders-secretly-hooked-on-mobile-games-ignore-national-disasters.html">political satire</a>, which some are calling the "Democratic Donnybrook," has left many wondering if the party will ever recover.</p>
<p>At the center of the controversy is Senator Thomas J. Jefferson, who is under fire for his role in the party's devastating loss in the recent midterm <a href="1-constitutional-crisis-erupts-strategy-games-reveal-hidden-agenda-in-election.html">election</a>s. "T.J., as he is known to his colleagues, has been accused of everything from stealing campaign funds to sabotaging the party's platform," reported a senior <a href="17-shocking-new-evidence-uncovers-decades-old-corruption-scheme-in-senate-leading.html">Senate</a> aide on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>But Jefferson is not the only one taking heat. Fellow Senator and self-proclaimed "Lord of the <a href="32-president-proposes-radical-futurist-economic-overhaul-will-it-save-or.html">Senate</a>" Barry M. Obama has also come under fire for his handling of the party's messaging. "Barry's been accused of being too focused on his own celebrity status and not enough on the issues that matter to voters," said a fellow Senator, who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>The situation has become so dire that some are calling for the removal of both Jefferson and Obama from the <a href="33-shocking-twist-in-impeachment-battle-political-strategists-turn-to-strategy.html">Senate</a>. "These two are a cancer on the party and need to be taken out," said one angry Democrat, who refused to give his name.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other members of the party are trying to stay above the fray. "I'm just focusing on my work and doing what's best for the American people," said Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has been conspicuously absent from the conflict.</p>
<p>As the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the Democratic party in the <a href="2-impeached-senator-caught-in-taxation-trouble-new-scandal-rocks-capitol.html">Senate</a> is in disarray, and it may be a long time before they can recover. "This is a dark time for the party, but we will get through it together," said a spokesperson for the party.</p>
<p>But not everyone is so optimistic. "The Democratic party is finished," said one political analyst. "They were unable to present a coherent message to voters and now they are paying the price."</p>
<p>Only time will tell if the party can overcome its internal divisions and find a way to win back the trust of the American people. But one thing is for sure: the Democratic Donnybrook in the Senate is just getting started.</p>
