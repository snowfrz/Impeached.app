<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a bold move to ensure the survival of humanity, the Democratic Party has announced the introduction of a groundbreaking constitutional amendment. The amendment, which is expected to be unveiled in the coming weeks, aims to address the looming threat of a <a href="4-democrats-secretly-planning-to-declare-war-on-americas-history-exclusive.html">dystopian</a> future and will be hailed as a beacon of hope for generations to come.</p>
<p>According to sources within the party, the amendment will focus on harnessing the power of science to protect the planet and its inhabitants from the ravages of climate change, technological advancements, and other potential threats.</p>
<p>"We cannot afford to sit idly by as the future of humanity hangs in the balance," said Senator Jane Doe, the lead sponsor of the amendment. "This amendment is a bold step towards a brighter, more sustainable future for all."</p>
<p>The amendment will reportedly include provisions for the establishment of a permanent Department of Futurism, which will be tasked with monitoring and mitigating the impact of emerging technologies on society. Additionally, it will provide for the allocation of vast resources towards the development of sustainable energy sources and the implementation of cutting-edge technologies to combat the effects of climate change.</p>
<p>But not everyone is convinced of the amendment's potential to save humanity from a dystopian future. Critics argue that the amendment is too broad and open to interpretation, leaving room for corruption and abuse of power.</p>
<p>"This amendment is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to consolidate power and control over the lives of citizens," said Representative John Smith, a vocal opponent of the amendment. "We must not sacrifice our freedom and autonomy in the name of saving the planet."</p>
<p>Despite these reservations, the amendment is expected to garner widespread support from the public and the media, who are eager for any solution to the challenges facing humanity. The amendment's supporters argue that it is a necessary step towards ensuring the survival of the human race in the face of an uncertain future.</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the fate of humanity hangs in the balance, and the future will be decided by the outcome of this historic amendment. Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story.</p>
