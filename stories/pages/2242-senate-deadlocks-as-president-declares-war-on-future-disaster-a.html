<p>In a stunning turn of events, the United States <a href="149-supreme-court-ruling-unearths-political-corruption-in-senate-elections-strategy.html">Senate</a> found itself in a deadlock today, as <a href="501-exclusive-how-taxation-tactics-are-becoming-the-new-political-satire.html">President</a> Predicta unveiled his ambitious new initiative to combat future <a href="49-gop-leaders-secretly-hooked-on-mobile-games-ignore-national-disasters.html">disaster</a>s: a full-blown <a href="1569-exclusive-inside-the-republican-led-war-on-tax-fairness-how-political.html">war</a> on climate change. "We're not just predicting the future anymore," declared Predicta, standing in front of a backdrop of what appeared to be a 3D-printed, miniature Earth, "we're taking control of it. And by control, I mean we're declaring <a href="823-exclusive-report-how-gaming-strategies-are-secretly-shaping-the-next.html">war</a> on it."</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <a href="6-breaking-presidential-election-shocker---candidate-reveals-secret-war-agenda.html">President</a>'s spokesbots quickly clarified that this was not a literal <a href="2097-supreme-court-to-decide-fate-of-historic-war-era-video-game.html">war</a>, but a metaphorical battle to reduce carbon emissions to zero by the year 2050. However, the military was not left out of the loop. The Department of Defense was tasked with leading the charge, deploying an unspecified number of weather-modifying drones, and establishing a new branch of the armed forces: the Climate Commandos.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <a href="389-exclusive-presidents-bold-move-on-freedom-sparks-senate-showdown-amidst.html">Senate</a>, meanwhile, was split down the middle. On one side, the Green Guardians, a coalition of senators who wear leaf-shaped lapel pins and believe that solar flares cause seasonal affective disorder, were all for the <a href="1607-exclusive-house-of-representatives-secret-tax-deal-democrats-accuse-president.html">President</a>'s plan. "If we don't act now, we'll be swimming in a sea of our own tears by 2050," <a href="583-exclusive-inside-the-dystopian-strategy-thats-polarizing-the-house-and.html">war</a>ned Senator Solarleaf.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Opposing them were the Fossil Factions, a group of senators who still receive their mail via horse-drawn carriage and have an unusual fondness for petroleum-based cologne. "We're not declaring <a href="572-exclusive-how-the-house-of-representatives-uncovered-a-deep-rooted-corruption.html">war</a> on the future, we're declaring peace with it," argued Senator Coalvein. "Why don't we just let nature take its course? It's been around longer than any of us, after all."</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a surprising turn of events, the impasse was broken by the unexpected entrance of the Bipartisan Bean Council, a group known for their legislative efforts to promote the consumption of legumes. They proposed a compromise: a bi-partisan, bi-carbonated, bi-omniscient approach to the problem. Their solution? A nationwide campaign to convert all carbon emissions into soda. "It's a win-win," explained Council chair Bean Brewster. "We reduce emissions, and Americans get a fizzy kick to fight climate change fatigue."</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the <a href="500-exclusive-inside-the-senates-secret-strategy-to-combat-supreme-court.html">Senate</a> debated the merits of carbonated solutions, <a href="1766-shocking-as-nation-reels-from-unprecedented-disaster-leaked-emails-reveal.html">President</a> Predicta signed an executive order declaring that all future presidential addresses would be delivered in a specially designed, hurricane-proof bunker, complete with a state-of-the-art hydroponic garden. "We're not just preparing for the future," said Predicta, adjusting his gas mask. "We're living it."</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the end, the <a href="1386-shocking-revelation-congressional-report-exposes-hidden-economic-agenda-behind-senates.html">Senate</a> approved the <a href="2240-scandal-in-the-halls-of-power-how-a-republican-presidents.html">President</a>'s initiative with a narrow margin, ensuring that the <a href="908-exclusive-report-how-a-secret-network-of-wealthy-donors-is.html">war</a> on future <a href="1300-exclusive-supreme-courts-shocking-ruling-on-free-speech-in-the.html">disaster</a>s would commence as planned. The country braced itself for the odd sight of Climate Commandos marching through the streets, armed with sunscreen and wind turbines, ready to take on the enemy: the unpredictable, capricious, and entirely non-sentient entity known as the atmosphere.</p>
