                <p></p>
<p>In a twist that has sent shockwaves through the hallowed halls of Capitol Hill, a little-known clause in the <a href="55-breaking-constitutional-crisis-looms-as-president-unveils-radical-economic-plan.html">Constitution</a> has resurfaced, threatening to upend the next congressional <a href="298-election-shockwave-how-a-mobile-gaming-sensation-unites-republicans-and.html">election</a> and ignite a national <a href="211-exclusive-report-dystopian-future-or-political-game-the-shocking-truth.html">controversy</a> that could make Watergate look like a schoolyard scuffle.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The clause, Article XXXIV, Section 18, previously thought to be a typographical error, clearly states that every ten years, a "political jousting tournament" must be held to determine the representation of each state in <a href="324-congress-baffled-mobile-gaming-industry-surges-past-economists-predictions-amidst.html">Congress</a>. The provision, which has been widely ignored since its purported ratification by a caffeinated George Washington in a sugar-fueled late-night Senate session, mandates that candidates must engage in a series of medieval-style battles, from jousting to the ancient sport of "Human Chess," to earn their place in the legislative body.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The revelation came to light when a diligent intern, Oliver, stumbling upon dusty tomes in the National Archives' basement, stumbled upon the hidden article. Oliver, armed with nothing but a flashlight and an ancient scroll, alerted his superiors, who promptly dismissed him for "late-night snack spills on important documents."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Undeterred, Oliver leaked the information to the press, sparking a frenzy of legal experts and political strategists scrambling to interpret the archaic law. The Republican elephant and the Democratic donkey found themselves in an unlikely alliance, both agreeing that this "jousting" business was a tad impractical in today's political climate.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, a maverick senator from the state of Gallantia, known for its annual Renaissance Faire, seized the opportunity to challenge the status quo. Senator Sir Gallivant the Third, a direct descendant of the Knights of the Round Table, declared, "If <a href="305-shocking-revelations-deep-states-role-in-recent-impeachment-uncovered-as.html">Congress</a> must joust, then <a href="240-exclusive-how-the-united-states-most-controversial-tax-law-in.html">Congress</a> shall joust!" His popularity soared as voters flocked to social media to express their support for this medieval showdown.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the nation braces for what could be the most unconventional political spectacle in history, the political elite are scrambling to draft modern interpretations of the ancient law. Proposals include a "Symbolic Jousting Metaphor" where candidates engage in debates armed with nothing but clever repartee and a "Tournament of Minds" featuring intellectual battles instead of actual swords and shields.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a press conference, the Speaker of the House, Madam Pelosi-Savvy, donned a helmet and shield, declaring, "Our founding fathers intended for our elected officials to be brave, courageous, and willing to fight for the people. If this <a href="284-exclusive-the-unprecedented-showdown-how-a-controversial-bill-threatens-the.html">Constitution</a>-mandated tournament is the price we must pay for true representation, then so be it!"</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the nation gears up for a political spectacle that could redefine the term "campaign trail," the only certainty is that the next congressional <a href="117-shocking-twist-in-american-politics-how-the-impeachment-of-a.html">election</a> will be one for the history books, or at least the pages of Mad Magazine.</p>
