                <p></p>
<p>In a shocking turn of events that has left political pundits scratching their heads and children everywhere dreaming of a future in politics, a precocious 11-year-old <a href="392-exclusive-the-presidents-controversial-plan-to-tax-quantum-computing-and.html">science</a> prodigy named Timmy Tinkerpot has unveiled a <a href="184-senate-shock-daring-campaign-strategy-reveals-secret-path-to-passing.html">campaign</a> proposal that is leaving seasoned politicians quivering in their boots. The young phenom, who has already invented a self-cleaning sandwich and a way to make broccoli taste like chocolate, has set his sights on the highest political office in the land – the Presidency of the <a href="1140-exclusive-how-the-governments-bizarre-response-to-a-major-disaster.html">United States</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>During a testify hearing before the <a href="698-shocking-revelation-president-signs-controversial-dystopian-legislation-into-law-sparking.html">Senate</a>, where the average age of the attendees could easily have doubled the national debt, Timmy presented his vision for a "Smart America." The proposal, which he hand-drew on a napkin from the <a href="735-unveiled-how-a-mobile-gaming-sensation-exposed-a-century-old-senate.html">Senate</a> cafeteria, includes revolutionary ideas such as:</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. Mandatory recess for Congress to encourage bipartisan playground diplomacy.</p>
<p>2. A policy to ensure every government document is written in crayon, making them accessible to "the common citizen."</p>
<p>3. A national <a href="528-unveiling-the-constitutions-hidden-strategy-how-a-game-inspired-by.html">science</a> fair to replace traditional political debates, with contestants battling it out with volcano eruptions and lemon battery circuits rather than sound bites and attack ads.</p>
<p>4. The introduction of a "Cool Factor" metric to evaluate the effectiveness of government policies, with points awarded for the inclusion of slime, glow sticks, and anything that can be launched from a Nerf gun.</p>
<p>5. And, most controversially, the appointment of a 7-year-old girl who can burp the alphabet as the new Secretary of Defense, to ensure that "our military strategies are as robust and unexpected as a fourth grader's belch."</p>
<p></p>
<p>While the proposal was met with a mix of bewilderment and awe, some senators were overheard muttering, "Maybe there's something to this kid's ideas. I mean, at least it's a change from the usual hot mess." Others were more skeptical, with one seasoned senator stating, "This is America, young man. You can't run for <a href="153-exclusive-supreme-court-delivers-devastating-blow-to-us-economy--.html">President</a> until you've at least tried a political smear <a href="738-exclusive-how-a-controversial-strategy-game-became-the-secret-weapon.html">campaign</a> and been voted off the school board."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Timmy, unfazed by the mixed reactions, simply responded with a shrug and a promise to unveil his top-secret weapon: a solar-powered, biodegradable robot that will <a href="585-unveiling-the-secret-strategy-how-freedom-play-in-popular-games.html">campaign</a> for him by performing Magic Tree House book reports at early voting locations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the nation watches this unprecedented race unfold, one thing is clear: the future of American politics may very well be in the hands of a child with a lab coat and a packet of Kool-Aid. God help us all.</p>
