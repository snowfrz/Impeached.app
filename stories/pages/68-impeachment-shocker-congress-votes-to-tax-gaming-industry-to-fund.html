<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, <a href="54-shocking-new-evidence-reveals-constitutional-crisis-imminent-congress-plots-to.html">Congress</a> has voted to impeach itself in response to the growing backlog of uncompleted <a href="25-supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-election-altering-legislation-science-community.html">legislation</a>. In a move that has left many pundits scratching their heads, lawmakers have decided to tax the <a href="18-democrats-propose-shocking-new-taxation-plan-to-save-economy-but.html">gaming</a> industry to fund their new <a href="3-shocking-new-bill-proposes-to-make-president-for-life-will.html">legislation</a>.</p>
<p>"We're simply running out of options," said Representative John Smith (R-OH). "We've been trying to pass new laws for years, but every time we think we've got something good, it just gets stuck in committee. So, we've come to the obvious conclusion: taxing the <a href="60-congress-in-crisis-mobile-game-scandal-threatens-to-upend-political.html">gaming</a> industry will solve all of our problems."</p>
<p>Despite the initial reluctance of some lawmakers, the tax on <a href="50-history-rewritten-new-evidence-suggests-ancient-civilization-created-video-games.html">gaming</a> revenue has gained widespread support. "It's a fair and reasonable solution," said Senator Jane Doe (D-CA). "After all, who doesn't love playing video games? It's only fitting that we should profit from their addiction."</p>
<p>The proposed tax would be set at 10% on all <a href="11-impeached-presidents-secret-gaming-strategy-revealed-how-hell-win-disaster-ridden.html">gaming</a> revenue, with the funds earmarked for a new "Legislation Completion Fund." According to estimates, the tax could generate upwards of $10 billion in revenue, more than enough to fund the completion of all outstanding <a href="23-taxation-in-the-age-of-strategic-games-are-we-entering.html">legislation</a>.</p>
<p>Not everyone is convinced, however. "This is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to line the pockets of <a href="47-congress-moves-to-restrict-freedom-in-bid-to-avert-economic.html">Congress</a> with money from the <a href="8-revealed-republicans-secretly-developing-disaster-proof-strategy-games-to-take-over.html">gaming</a> industry," said Representative Bob Johnson (R-TX). "We all know that the <a href="31-shocking-new-evidence-reveals-decades-old-gaming-corruption-scandal-in-house.html">gaming</a> industry has far too much influence over our lawmaking already. This just takes it to a whole new level."</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the <a href="45-democrats-unveil-revolutionary-new-gaming-strategy-to-win-impeachment-showdown.html">gaming</a> industry is about to get a whole lot more expensive. "We're just trying to get the job done," said Representative Smith. "And if that means taxing the fun out of video games, so be it."</p>
