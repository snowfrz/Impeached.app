                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Impeached 2 is an armchair politician's dream. <a
                        href="../../get.html">Play today!</a></p>
                <p></p>
<p>In a stunning revelation that has sent shockwaves through the hallowed halls of Capitol Hill, our sources have uncovered a clandestine meeting where the future of <a href="105-exposed-how-a-shadowy-network-of-politicians-and-corporations-is.html">taxation</a> was being decided not by the wise and erudite members of the <a href="102-title-unprecedented-move-us-house-of-representatives-declares-war-on.html">House of Representatives</a>, but by a group of pint-sized digital gurus from the mobile gaming industry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The plot, as thick and convoluted as the plot of the latest hit game "Candy Crush: Saga of the Tax Evaders," sees <a href="61-president-proposes-controversial-new-war-legislation-republicans-outraged-this-is.html">President</a> "SwipeRight" and his cabinet of "Angry Taxmen" locked in a high-stakes political chess match with the "Congress of Clashers" in the <a href="121-breaking-supreme-court-ruling-paves-way-for-groundbreaking-science-that.html">House of Representatives</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Insiders report that the <a href="98-exclusive-supreme-courts-stunning-ruling-could-upend-the-next-presidential.html">President</a>, in a bid to appease his corporate overlords, has agreed to a series of tax loopholes so wide you could drive a semi-truck filled with virtual currency through them. These loopholes, cleverly disguised as incentives for small businesses, are in fact a lifeline for the mobile gaming juggernauts who are raking in the dough faster than a player can collect three matching candies for a power-up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The House, led by the crafty Speaker "PokeMaster," has been playing a long game, using subcommittees and legislative maneuvers akin to in-game power-ups to slow down the <a href="6-breaking-presidential-election-shocker---candidate-reveals-secret-war-agenda.html">President</a>'s moves. But with the mobile gaming lobby wielding influence like a rare digital artifact, the game is teetering on the edge of a pay-to-win scenario.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our sources have obtained a leaked document, titled "The Taxation Tactics of Tapville," which outlines a strategy to manipulate the tax code in such a way that the mobile gaming industry could effectively become a tax haven, with income floating in a digital limbo, untouched by the greedy hands of the IRS.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The implications of this political chess match are profound. If successful, the mobile gaming industry could set a precedent for tax avoidance that could see other industries following suit, turning the entire American tax system into an interactive game of cat and mouse, with the American people as the unwitting players.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the nation watches with bated breath, the fate of <a href="89-unveiled-the-revolutionary-18th-century-tax-strategy-thats-shaking-up.html">taxation</a> hangs in the balance, much like the last life of a hardcore gamer facing the final boss of fiscal policy. Will the <a href="32-president-proposes-radical-futurist-economic-overhaul-will-it-save-or.html">President</a> and the mobile gaming moguls emerge victorious, or will the <a href="43-impeached-again-shocking-new-developments-in-washington-shake-up-political.html">House of Representatives</a> level up their <a href="77-president-proposes-new-tax-on-gaming-industry-sparking-controversy-among.html">taxation</a> skills in time to save the day? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: the game is afoot, and the stakes have never been higher.</p>
