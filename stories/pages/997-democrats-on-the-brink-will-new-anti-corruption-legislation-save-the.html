<p>In an extraordinary turn of events, the United States <a href="588-unveiled-how-gaming-science-is-revolutionizing-political-strategy-in-the.html">Senate</a>, traditionally a bastion of statesmanship and impartial governance, has found itself on the brink of self-implosion. Amidst a series of high-profile scandals involving a who's who of Democratic senators, the party has banded together to pass a groundbreaking piece of <a href="296-unprecedented-bipartisan-bill-introduced-to-guarantee-freedom-in-the-age.html">legislation</a> aimed at rooting out the very cancer that has afflicted their own ranks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dubbed the "Senatorial Ethics and Accountability Act," or SEAA for the uninitiated, the bill proposes a series of stringent measures that range from mandatory weekly polygraph tests to the implementation of a "politician-to-lobbyist" tracking system that would alert citizens any time a senator winks at a former colleague.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <a href="725-unprecedented-gaming-revolution-how-a-new-constitutional-amendment-is-set.html">legislation</a>'s sponsor, Senator Purity Heart (D-VT), with a perfect score from the watchdog group "Citizens for Integrity and Clean Air," promised that the SEAA would "drain the swamp that is our own senate." Heart, who was seen recently donning a superhero cape emblazoned with the words "Clean Sweep Crusader," is said to be personally overseeing the implementation of the bill's provisions, including the creation of an "Ethics Ombudsman" position, which, in a nod to the recent Hollywood trend, will be filled by the first artificial intelligence known to possess both unimpeachable integrity and the ability to discern truth from fiction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Critics, however, have been quick to point out that the legislative band-aid may not address the underlying issues that have led to the current predicament. "It's like putting a 'Beware of Dog' sign on a yard where the dog has long since been replaced by a mechanical barker," quipped political pundit Jasper Droll (I-Indifference). "It's all show, no substance."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Others have suggested that the SEAA could backfire, potentially alienating the very voters the <a href="926-supreme-showdown-how-a-mobile-gaming-tax-saga-could-shake.html">Democrats</a> are trying to woo with their newfound commitment to <a href="525-exclusive-how-mobile-gaming-titans-secretly-lobby-to-shape-new.html">corruption</a>ption measures. "If these senators are innocent, as they claim, then why the rush to pass a law that seems tailor-made for them? It smells of desperation," opined political analyst Eleanor Bleakley (R-Realpolitik).</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the <a href="432-unprecedented-disaster-relief-bill-stalls-as-supreme-court-weighs-in.html">Senate</a> barrels toward a vote on the SEAA, the nation watches with bated breath, wondering if this latest legislative gambit will serve as a shining example of self-regulation, or if it will simply add another chapter to the ongoing saga of political theater in the world's greatest deliberative body. Only time will tell if the <a href="516-exclusive-investigation-how-a-secret-network-of-senators-and-court.html">Senate</a>'s new watchdog will be able to sniff out the truth or if it will join the ranks of legislative Roto-Rooters, designed to give the illusion of action without ever really getting to the heart of the problem.</p>
