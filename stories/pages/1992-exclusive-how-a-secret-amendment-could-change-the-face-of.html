                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Impeached 2 is an armchair politician's dream. <a

                <p></p>
<p>In a shocking turn of events that has left political pundits and average citizens alike in a state of stupefied disbelief, it has been exclusively revealed that a clandestine amendment was quietly slipped into the <a href="1043-exposed-how-a-dystopian-vision-of-corruption-threatens-the-foundations.html">Constitution</a> last night under the cover of a nationwide blackout, allegedly caused by a "solar event."</p>
<p></p>
<p>The amendment, which has yet to be officially acknowledged by the government, purportedly grants <a href="613-exclusive-presidents-controversial-supreme-court-nominee-stirs-political-firestorm-amidst.html">President</a> Supernova the power to declare <a href="499-scandal-rocks-the-nation-governments-secret-war-time-tax-policies-revealed.html">war</a> without Congressional approval, should the situation arise that the United States is under attack by "extraterrestrial beings or otherworldly phenomena." Furthermore, the <a href="1733-explosive-revelations-how-mobile-games-became-the-key-to-unraveling.html">President</a> is granted emergency powers to "reallocate resources and mobilize the National Guard to build interdimensional portal defense systems."</p>
<p></p>
<p>According to whistleblower "Patriotic Pen," who provided documents to our intrepid investigative team under the pseudonym "Nighthawk," the amendment was passed by a "covert session of the Continental Congress, held in a secret location beneath the Capitol, protected by a dome of telepathic squirrels." The source claims that the session was attended by "selected representatives from each state, teleported to the location by a mysterious figure known only as 'The <a href="1217-exclusive-how-strategy-games-are-shaping-the-unexpected-election-strategies.html">Constitution</a>'s Custodian.'"</p>
<p></p>
<p>The White House has released a statement, asserting that no such amendment exists and that the nation experienced a "routine solar event" which temporarily disrupted power grids across the country. Spokesperson "Press-On Button" assured the public that "there are no changes to the powers of the Presidency as outlined in the <a href="928-supreme-showdown-how-mobile-gaming-became-the-unexpected-battleground-for.html">Constitution</a>, and the safety and security of the American people remain the Administration's top priority."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Meanwhile, political analysts are scratching their heads in confusion, with some suggesting that the amendment could be a "false flag operation" designed to distract the public from more pressing issues, such as the impending "quokka invasion" or the "suspiciously consistent" weather patterns plaguing the nation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a statement that could only be described as Orwellian, Senator "Fiscal Cliff" stated, "If there is an amendment, it is a test of our national resolve and a measure to ensure that the United States remains a beacon of hope in the face of potential interdimensional threats. We must be prepared to defend our reality."</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the nation grapples with the implications of this revelation, many are left wondering if this is, in fact, a brilliant satirical piece designed to highlight the absurdity of political machinations. One thing is clear: the face of American <a href="1756-exclusive-deep-state-whistleblower-exposes-alarming-gop-linked-corruption-nexus-in.html">politics</a>, as we know it, could be forever altered—should we find ourselves on the wrong side of an interdimensional portal. God save the <a href="174-explosive-expos-how-a-shadowy-network-of-corruption-fueled-a.html">Constitution</a>.</p>
