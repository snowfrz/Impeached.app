<p>In a shocking turn of events that has left political pundits with ink-stained fingers and a plethora of conspiracy theories, the <a href="24-supreme-shock-us-disasters-threaten-to-upend-taxation-laws-igniting.html">United States</a> has witnessed its first-ever <a href="382-shocking-revelation-major-campaign-exposed-for-allegedly-manipulating-science-to.html">impeachment</a> of a sitting president immediately following a general <a href="1684-exclusive-how-a-political-satirist-uncovered-a-shocking-connection-between.html">election</a>. The unprecedented move, which has sent shockwaves through the fabric of American political norms, came after President Donald J. Twicewind, known for his flamboyant comb-overs and penchant for tweeting at all hours, was accused of "campaign mismanagement" by the newly empowered Congress.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <a href="753-exclusive-political-satirists-prophetic-skit-on-impeachment-sparks-debate-on.html">impeachment</a>, which took place in the early hours of November 4th, was a direct response to Twicewind's alleged misuse of campaign funds to finance a fleet of personalized hovercrafts, intended for his post-presidential leisure activities. According to the highly detailed and factually accurate report filed by the House Oversight Committee, these hovercrafts were adorned with gold leafing and featured state-of-the-art plasma screen televisions, presumably for watching reruns of his own administration's highlights.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The nation watched in awe as Vice President Michael Pence-and-Half, sworn in just hours before as the de facto leader, announced the historic <a href="1103-resp.html">impeachment</a>. "In the grand tradition of our Founding Fathers, who wisely chose to impeach both Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton for their various infractions, we are today setting a new precedent," Pence-and-Half proclaimed, his hand never straying far from the ceremonial leather-bound copy of the Constitution he clutched.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Senate, now under the control of the opposition party, quickly convened to consider the articles of <a href="539-shocking-revelation-gaming-giants-ceo-secretly-advised-on-impeachment-strategy.html">impeachment</a>. The trial, which featured a who's who of D-list celebrities as impartial jurors, including the likes of Snooki from "Jersey Shore" and the guy who played Joey on "Friends," was as raucous as it was legally binding. The high point of the proceedings was undoubtedly when Senator Mitch McConnell-Like, with a twinkle in his eye, moved to adjourn the trial for a six-month golfing vacation in Scotland, a motion that was surprisingly seconded by every single member of the Senate.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the dust settled and the nation grappled with the implications of this <a href="261-exclusive-unprecedented-political-shockwave-how-impeachment-of-a-us-leader.html">impeachment</a>, political analysts predicted that the next president, a mysterious figure known only as "Anyone But Those Two," would have their work cut out for them. In the meantime, President Twicewind, now a two-time <a href="1934-unprecedented-how-gaming-culture-influenced-the-impeachment-of-a-futuristic.html">impeachment</a> veteran, was reportedly seen at a local steakhouse, signing autographs and discussing the possibility of launching his own line of commemorative hovercraft models, surely destined to become collector's items.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In an exclusive interview with our correspondent, who braved the chaos to get a word in edgewise, Twicewind simply chuckled and replied, "Well, at least now I'll have plenty of free time to enjoy my new toys. And who knows? Maybe I'll write a book about it. 'The Art of the Hovercraft: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Impeachment.'"</p>

<p>This story, of course, is entirely fictional and any resemblance to actual events or persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental. Or is it? Stay tuned, America, because in this political climate, truth really is stranger than fiction.</p>
