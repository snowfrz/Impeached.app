<p>In an unprecedented display of constitutional bravery, the <a href="412-senate-showdown-mobile-gaming-phenomenon-becomes-unexpected-election-strategy-tool.html">Senate</a> majority, led by the fearless Republican Leader, Senator John 'Rightshot' Thompson, has passed a groundbreaking resolution that promises to inscribe the Second Amendment rights of Americans into the very bedrock of the universe. The resolution, known as the "Cosmic Carry Permit Act," was approved with a staggering 87-11 vote, a number that defies all odds and political logic.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The bill, which is sure to send shockwaves through the fabric of reality, asserts that any individual born with a heartbeat, or as the resolution delicately puts, "a measurable thump-thump sound originating from the chest cavity," is entitled to bear arms, not just within the borders of the United States, but throughout the Omniverse. This includes the right to openly carry a weapon of choice, be it a blaster, a lightsaber, or even a "friendly neighborhood" superhero's utility <a href="312-unbelievable-how-a-strategy-game-is-shaping-futurist-policy-in.html">Congress</a>>
<p></p>
<p>Congressman 'Gunsmith' Garrison, the legislative maverick behind this cosmic initiative, told our correspondent, "Why should Americans be confined to mere galaxies when they have the divine right to wield their constitutional arms across the infinite expanses of space and time? We're not just talking about protecting the home front here; we're talking about safeguarding the multiverse!"</p>
<p></p>
<p>The move has sparked a interstellar debate, with galactic factions weighing in on the implications of such a sweeping proclamation. Meanwhile, the National Space Defense League has hailed the resolution as a victory for <a href="56-supreme-court-rules-dystopian-future-looms-as-freedom-takes-a.html">freedom</a>, vowing to train space cadets in the art of interplanetary marksmanship.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Environmentalists, however, have raised concerns about the potential ecological impact of high-caliber firefights on the Martian landscape. "We're not against the Second Amendment per se," said Martian Eco-Activist Marsha 'Starchild' O'Conner, "but can't we at least agree that a quiet night on Mars should be as peaceful as a lullaby on Earth?"</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the debate rages on, all eyes are now on the Supreme Court, where the "Cosmic Carry Permit Act" is expected to face a cosmic showdown of its own. Legal scholars are divided, with some arguing that the <a href="1338-shocking-revelation-the-unseen-clause-in-the-constitution-that-could.html">Constitution</a>'s framers intended to protect individual rights within the confines of a relatively small nation, while others believe that the right to bear arms is as boundless as the universe itself.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Stay tuned as this story unfolds faster than a speeding bullet, with more twists and turns than a well-oiled M60 machine gun. Will the Supreme Court uphold this intergalactic interpretation of the Second Amendment, or will it be considered a bridge too far? Only time, and a highly trained team of constitutional space marshals, will tell.</p>
