                <p></p>
<p>In a daring move that has left political pundits and the general public alike reeling with disbelief, sources close to the Democratic Party have leaked details of a clandestine operation aimed at single-handedly eradicating <a href="51-breaking-house-of-representatives-votes-to-ban-mobile-games-over.html">corruption</a> in American politics. The plan, codenamed "Operation Clean Slate," involves a time-traveling delegation sent back to the year 1776 to convince the Founding Fathers to include a clause in the original U.S. Constitution that outlaws the acceptance of foreign lobbying money, lobbyist gifts, and any form of bribery in American politics.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The audacious strategy, masterminded by a shadowy coalition of data scientists, quantum physicists, and political strategists, was confirmed by an anonymous source who go by the pseudonym "Tom Paine II." "We're tired of playing by the rules that were written before the first political action committee even existed," said Paine II, his voice a blend of revolutionary fervor and futuristic determination. "If we can't change the present, we'll change the past. It's the only way to ensure a <a href="72-revealed-gaming-industry-secretly-funding-republican-impeachment-efforts.html">corruption</a>-free future for the <a href="84-shocking-new-tax-plan-unveiled-by-senate-democrats-could-upend.html">United States</a>."</p>
<p></p>
<p>The plan is not without its risks. The time-traveling team, equipped with advanced stealth technology and history-approved attire, must navigate the delicate social and political landscapes of the 18th century while avoiding drawing attention to themselves. Should they succeed, however, the ripples of their actions would not only prevent centuries of political <a href="17-shocking-new-evidence-uncovers-decades-old-corruption-scheme-in-senate-leading.html">corruption</a> but also shape the course of American history in ways that are currently beyond our imagination.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a related development, the <a href="18-democrats-propose-shocking-new-taxation-plan-to-save-economy-but.html">Democrats</a> have also been rumored to be developing a second initiative, "Project Visionary," which involves creating a think tank of futuristic experts to predict and influence the political landscape up to two centuries from now. "We're not just playing the long game; we're playing the no-game," remarked a second anonymous source known as "Hamilton X." "We're redefining what it means to be politically strategic. With these initiatives, we're not just shaping the next election; we're shaping the next millennium."</p>
<p></p>
<p>While the party remains tight-lipped about the specifics of these operations, insiders say that the <a href="24-supreme-shock-us-disasters-threaten-to-upend-taxation-laws-igniting.html">Democrats</a> are preparing to unveil their grand plan during the next major political event, a move that is expected to send shockwaves through the political establishment and ignite a new era of political innovation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the nation holds its breath, the question on everyone's lips is: Will the <a href="76-shocking-twist-impeached-senator-caught-running-tax-scam.html">Democrats</a>' bold gambit to combat <a href="88-congress-in-crisis-new-evidence-of-widespread-corruption-rocks-the.html">corruption</a> pay off, or will history prove to be an impossible adversary? Only time—and perhaps a few well-placed time travelers—will tell.</p>
