                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Impeached 2 is an armchair politician's dream. <a

                <p></p>
<p>In an unprecedented twist that has sent shockwaves through the political landscape, the <a href="212-unprecedented-showdown-house-of-representatives-on-collision-course-with-supreme.html">Supreme Court</a> has just ruled that every citizen must pay their taxes forward in a complex barter system, using only hand-drawn Renaissance artwork as legal tender. The decision, which came down like a hammer in a bizarrely quiet room, has the potential to completely upend the 2024 presidential race, with political analysts predicting a surge in candidates who are both art historians and tax experts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The ruling, authored by the Court's most enigmatic figure, Justice Artemis I. Mousington, declared that the current <a href="1332-unveiled-the-governments-dystopian-disaster-response-plan-and-how-its.html">taxation</a> laws were "as outdated as a flip phone at a rave," and that a more "dynamic and vibrant" approach to financial exchange was necessary to "revitalize the economy and bring a Renaissance of prosperity."</p>
<p></p>
<p>The political fallout has been immediate. Current frontrunners in both parties have found themselves in a comedic quagmire, with each attempting to out-artistic the other in a desperate bid to win over the newly minted "Art Voter." Presidential hopeful and renowned muralist, Leonardo 'Da Vince' DiCaprio, has been seen canvasing in key states, offering to paint murals of Americans' tax payments in exchange for votes, while his rival, 'Hamilton' Treasury Secretary Alex 'Washington' Hamilton, has countered with a campaign promise to distribute a limited edition print of the Constitution for every taxpayer who supports him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <a href="266-exclusive-how-a-popular-strategy-game-became-a-surprising-disaster.html">controversy</a> has even reached the halls of Congress, where a heated debate ensued over the constitutionality of the new ruling. In a turn of events that would make even the most seasoned political satirist blush, the House of Representatives has begun <a href="511-exclusive-impeachment-drama-unfolds-as-supreme-court-weighs-in-on.html">impeachment</a> proceedings against the IRS commissioner, accusing him of "tax evasion through Renaissance art appropriation."</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the nation grapples with this new reality, economists are predicting a surge in the stock market for art supply companies, while historians are celebrating the sudden relevance of their field. Meanwhile, the average Joe is left scratching their head, wondering if their kid's crayon drawings will now be the key to financial freedom.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this brave new world of <a href="329-senate-shock-mobile-gaming-empire-evades-taxes-amid-national-disaster.html">taxation</a>, one thing is clear: <a href="800-scandal-rocks-house-as-lawmakers-accused-of-using-mobile-strategy.html">politics</a> has officially entered the absurdity arena, and the 2024 presidential race is shaping up to be a spectacle that will have history painting a target on its back.</p>
