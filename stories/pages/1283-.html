                <p></p>
<p>In a stunning turn of events that has left political pundits and the American public equally dumbfounded, <a href="246-exclusive-presidents-shocking-tax-loophole-favoring-big-corp-revealed-amidst.html">President</a> Gigglebottom has just signed an executive order mandating that all members of <a href="48-revealed-secret-plan-by-republicans-to-end-freedom-in-america.html">Congress</a>, the <a href="438-scandal-at-the-highest-level-supreme-courts-historic-ruling-on.html">Supreme Court</a>, and any individual running for public office must undergo a rigorous series of scientific tests to determine their "truthfulness quotient" before they can officially register to run.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The tests, which are said to include a combination of lie detector examinations, polygraph tests, and a new, cutting-edge "Fact-O-Meter" device, are designed to ensure that only the most honest candidates make it onto the ballot. The <a href="55-breaking-constitutional-crisis-looms-as-president-unveils-radical-economic-plan.html">President</a>'s office has stated that this measure is crucial in restoring the public's faith in the electoral process, which has been marred by what the <a href="1212-exclusive-as-president-faces-impeachment-gop-faces-a-choice-between.html">President</a> calls "alternative facts" and "untruthful narratives."</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a related development, the <a href="407-exclusive-supreme-court-ruling-on-mobile-gaming-taxation-could-redefine.html">Supreme Court</a> has unanimously ruled that any elected official found to have misled the public during their campaign can be immediately recalled and replaced by a candidate chosen by a committee of seven-year-olds. The decision was met with applause from many citizens who believe that the innocence and candor of children are the antidotes to the current political climate.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="1198-exclusive-supreme-court-justice-spotted-playing-political-satire-strategy-game.html">Congress</a> has responded by drafting a counter-resolution that would require all scientific advisors to the government to undergo similar truthfulness evaluations. The resolution, which has been met with both confusion and laughter by the scientific community, also stipulates that any advisor who cannot pass the test must be replaced by a talking houseplant with a proven track record of truthfulness in public speaking engagements.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the nation braces for the upcoming <a href="344-democrats-brace-for-supreme-court-showdown-as-election-looms-amidst.html">election</a>s, political strategists are scrambling to find candidates who can both pass the truthfulness tests and appeal to voters. Early polls show a surprising lead for an independent candidate who has promised to bring "transparency and truth" to politics, a platform that resonates with a public weary of political games and eager for change.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In an effort to keep the public informed and engaged, a new reality TV show, "Political Polygraph," will air live, showcasing the truthfulness tests of various candidates. The show's host, a renowned polygraph expert known for his "steely gaze" and "unshakable questions," promises to "get to the bottom of who's telling the truth and who's not."</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the political landscape undergoes this radical transformation, citizens are left to wonder: will <a href="367-election-nightmare-how-a-gaming-genius-turned-strategy-games-into.html">science</a> save democracy, or will it reveal that the truth is truly stranger than fiction? Only time will tell, but one thing is for certain—the next <a href="1056-unprecedented-move-mobile-gaming-sensation-elected-to-house-of-representatives.html">election</a> will be unlike any we've seen before.</p>
