<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that the Republican-led <a href="44-breaking-new-evidence-reveals-secret-history-of-us-wars-shocks.html">Congress</a> has been secretly planning to end <a href="47-congress-moves-to-restrict-freedom-in-bid-to-avert-economic.html">freedom</a> in America... forever!  According to highly placed sources within the party, the GOP has been working on a top-secret plan to undermine the very foundation of American democracy.</p>
<p>"It's true, folks," said Rep. Bob Smith (R-Florida), a key architect of the plan. "We've been quietly chipping away at <a href="37-revealed-new-legislation-threatens-to-undermine-liberty-and-democracy-experts.html">freedom</a> for years, and now it's time to take the next step. We can't let the American people continue to enjoy the luxury of making their own choices and decisions. It's just too dangerous."</p>
<p>When pressed for details, Rep. Smith confirmed that the plan involves a comprehensive overhaul of the country's economic system, with the ultimate goal of creating a highly controlled and regulated society.</p>
<p>"Think about it," he said. "If we can take control of the economy, we can ensure that every decision is made with the greater good in mind. No more greed, no more selfishness. Just good, old-fashioned common sense."</p>
<p>But not everyone is convinced. Critics have accused the GOP of attempting to establish a "soft" dictatorship, where the rights of individuals are sacrificed for the greater good.</p>
<p>"This is a clear violation of the Constitution," said Rep. Jane Doe (D-California). "The Founding Fathers fought tooth and nail to ensure that America would remain a free and democratic society. We cannot let the <a href="12-republicans-facing-history-defining-controversy-war-erupts-over-e.html">Republicans</a> undermine that legacy."</p>
<p>As the controversy rages on, it remains to be seen how far the GOP will go in their quest for a more controlled society. But one thing is certain: this is a battle that will define the future of America. Stay tuned.</p>
