                <p></p>
<p>In a shocking turn of events that has left the nation's political pundits with whiplash, a recent <a href="314-scandal-rocks-capitol-hill-congressman-caught-in-web-of-corruption.html">Supreme Court</a> ruling has the potential to dismantle the entire foundation of the ongoing <a href="1638-shocking-turns-president-stands-on-the-brink-of-impeachment-as.html">impeachment</a> trial against President Snort McFlail. The decision, which involves a highly obscure clause from the 1820s, has been interpreted by some legal eagles with spectacles as big as the Capitol dome to suggest that any <a href="1984-unprecedented-twist-in-us-history-election-aftermath-leads-to-first-ever.html">impeachment</a> trial must be conducted with a minimum of four identical flying vehicles to substantiate the <a href="1990-exclusive-insider-reveals-the-shocking-political-strategy-that-could-flip.html">impeachment</a>'s legitimacy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sources close to the Senate's secret hangar, where these vehicles are rumored to be kept, have confirmed that only three matching UFOs were available at the commencement of the trial, casting serious doubt on the proceedings' validity. The revelation has sent shockwaves through the Democratic stronghold, with prominent party members seen frantically flipping through old dusty books of parliamentary procedures, looking for a loophole big enough to drive the fourth flying saucer through.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In response, President McFlail, who has been accused of everything from tax evasion to eating the entire population of a small Midwestern town, has declared a "victory for common sense and intergalactic cooperation." His press secretary, a man whose grasp on reality is as firm as a balloon in a hurricane, claimed that the ruling was a "game-changer" that would "expose the deep-seated <a href="1196-explosive-new-evidence-republicans-accused-of-orchestrating-impeachment-cover-up-to.html">corruption</a>" within the political system, which, ironically, the President has been accused of being a part of.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the <a href="1446-shocking-revelation-how-the-constitutions-clauses-could-alter-the-future.html">impeachment</a> trial hangs in the balance, with the fate of the fourth flying vehicle still up in the air, pundits and citizens alike are left to wonder what this means for the future of American democracy. Will the trial be delayed until another flying vehicle can be conjured by Congressional wizards? Or will this become a precedent, setting the stage for future presidents to claim innocence simply by invoking the "Four Flying Vehicle Rule"?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: the next <a href="523-scotus-shock-mobile-gaming-apps-accused-of-illegal-campaign-ties.html">impeachment</a> trial is going to need a lot more aviation fuel than previously anticipated. And perhaps, just perhaps, a few more flying vehicles. After all, in a world where the highest court's rulings can hinge on the number of extraterrestrial vessels, you have to wonder if we're not all just characters in a bizarre cosmic joke.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the meantime, political cartoonists are having a field day, and late-night talk show hosts are already scripting their monologues around this interstellar twist. The only question left is: Will the flying vehicles be adorned with campaign slogans, or will they stick to the classic "Vote for me, I'm an impeached president" bumper sticker? Only the winds of Capitol Hill can answer that.</p>
