<p>In a move that has left constitutional scholars rubbing their eyes in disbelief, the <a href="344-democrats-brace-for-supreme-court-showdown-as-election-looms-amidst.html">Supreme Court</a> has officially ruled that <a href="261-exclusive-unprecedented-political-shockwave-how-impeachment-of-a-us-leader.html">impeachment</a> is no longer a political process, but a scientific experiment. The landmark decision, delivered by Chief Justice Elon R. Scalia, states that the <a href="284-exclusive-the-unprecedented-showdown-how-a-controversial-bill-threatens-the.html">Constitution</a>'s <a href="244-exclusive-insider-reveals-how-republicans-anti-impeachment-stance-could-ignite-economic.html">impeachment</a> clause must be conducted with the utmost scientific rigor, citing the need for "empirical evidence and peer-reviewed methodologies" to determine the guilt or innocence of an impeached official.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The ruling, which has been nicknamed "The Galileo Decision" by pundits, mandates that all future <a href="130-exclusive-behind-the-scenes-of-the-election-campaign---how.html">impeachment</a> trials must be presided over by a panel of Nobel laureates, instead of senators. These esteemed scientists will be responsible for analyzing the "data" provided by both the House and the defense, using cutting-edge technology to detect truth from falsehood.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a press conference, Senator Mitch McConnellhair (R-KY) declared, "This is an unprecedented overreach by the judiciary. Next, they'll be telling us that the Electoral College needs a quantum computer to determine the president!" Meanwhile, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosiipoli (D-CA) excitedly proclaimed, "Science shall lead the way to justice! Who could be against evidence-based governance?"</p>
<p></p>
<p>The initial trial under this new protocol will feature President Joe Bidenomics, who is being impeached for his handling of a mysterious substance referred to only as "covfefe." The scientific panel has already begun experiments, including live-tweeting the president's daily activities under controlled conditions to determine the authenticity of his actions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In related news, the <a href="119-exclusive-bombshell-evidence-of-bipartisan-corruption-unearthed-ahead-of-impeachment.html">Senate</a> has announced the construction of a new wing to accommodate the influx of lab equipment and researchers. The facility, which will be equipped with a particle accelerator and a team of astrophysicists, is set to open in time for the next <a href="255-exclusive-inside-the-impeachment-firestorm--united-states-on-the.html">impeachment</a> trial.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the nation braces for this new chapter in constitutional governance, many are left wondering if this will finally put an end to the divisive nature of <a href="308-exclusive-mobile-game-developer-accidentally-creates-the-ultimate-political-satire.html">impeachment</a> proceedings. Others are simply concerned about the potential for "mad <a href="177-democrats-face-backlash-over-controversial-constitutional-amendment-proposal-aimed-at.html">science</a>" to take over Capitol Hill. But one thing is for certain: the political landscape will never be the same again.</p>
