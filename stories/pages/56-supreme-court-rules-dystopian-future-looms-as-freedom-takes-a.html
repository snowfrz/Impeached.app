<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="25-supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-election-altering-legislation-science-community.html">Supreme Court</a> has recently ruled in favor of <a href="2-impeached-senator-caught-in-taxation-trouble-new-scandal-rocks-capitol.html">political games</a> over individual <a href="46-breaking-democrats-unveil-revolutionary-new-mobile-game-to-win-back.html">freedom</a>, paving the way for a <a href="22-dystopian-constitution-crisis-threatens-to-upend-election.html">dystopian</a> future where the government has the power to regulate every aspect of citizens' lives.</p>
<p>"We are pleased to announce that our ruling will ensure the continuation of <a href="6-breaking-presidential-election-shocker---candidate-reveals-secret-war-agenda.html">political games</a> at the expense of personal liberties," said Chief Justice Maxine "The Matrix" Johnson. "In a world where <a href="16-breaking-war-over-supreme-court-election-threatens-to-erode-freedom.html">freedom</a> no longer exists, the government will be able to better control and manipulate the masses."</p>
<p>The ruling, which was handed down in a 5-4 decision, strikes down any notion of personal <a href="29-democrats-unveil-daring-new-political-strategy-freedom-from-the-supremes.html">freedom</a> and autonomy, and instead grants the government the authority to dictate every move and decision made by its citizens.</p>
<p>"The future is bright," said President Franklin "The Fascist" Franklin, who was thrilled by the ruling. "With the government holding all the cards, we can finally achieve the Utopia we've always dreamed of - a <a href="4-democrats-secretly-planning-to-declare-war-on-americas-history-exclusive.html">dystopian</a> future where everyone is happy and prosperous, as long as they do exactly as they are told."</p>
<p>Critics of the ruling have been quick to point out the implications of the decision, which they say will lead to a totalitarian regime where free will is nothing more than a distant memory.</p>
<p>"This ruling is a direct attack on the very fabric of our society," said Senator Elizabeth "The Resistance" Warren. "We must stand up and fight against this oppressive regime, before it's too late."</p>
<p>But for now, it seems the government has the upper hand, and the people are left to wonder what the future holds. Will they be forced to comply with every whim of their oppressors, or will they find a way to rise up and reclaim their <a href="21-shocking-senate-move-threatens-entire-government-experts-predict-strategy-game.html">freedom</a>? Only time will tell.</p>
