<p>In a stunning turn of events, the nation's most recent constitutional amendment has declared video games as the official language of the United States. Dubbed the "Interactive Fluency Act" (IFA), this groundbreaking <a href="708-exclusive-how-gaming-became-the-centerpiece-in-americas-most-divisive.html">legislation</a> has mandated that all American citizens must achieve a minimum level of <a href="11-impeached-presidents-secret-gaming-strategy-revealed-how-hell-win-disaster-ridden.html">gaming</a> proficiency by their 25th birthday or face the wrath of the IRS in the form of a hefty "Gamer's Tithe."</p>
<p></p>
<p>The IFA, which was passed unanimously by a congress filled with lawmakers who admittedly "couldn't tell a joystick from a joust," has set forth a series of <a href="228-unprecedented-how-gaming-culture-influenced-the-impeachment-of-a-politician.html">gaming</a> milestones that citizens must achieve. These include beating the legendary final boss of "Super Ninja Quest: The Odyssey of the Pixelated Warrior" or reaching the elusive "High King of the Skyrim" status. Failure to complete these tasks will result in a yearly tax of $10,000, levied against the citizen's virtual assets.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a press conference, President Progamer II, aka President Fidget Spinner, announced, "Our forefathers envisioned a nation where life, liberty, and the pursuit of the highest difficulty setting in 'Mario Bros.' would be inalienable rights. This amendment is not just about <a href="334-exclusive-inside-the-high-stakes-gaming-campaign-thats-shaking-up-political.html">gaming</a>; it's about unity, it's about the future. It's about making sure your character's inventory is always fully optimized."</p>
<p></p>
<p>In response to the new law, the Federal Bureau of Gaming Standards (FBGS) has been established to monitor and enforce <a href="679-explosive-revelation-how-a-legendary-video-game-foretold-the-future.html">gaming</a> competence across the nation. Agents, armed with controllers and a passion for quest logs, will be making unannounced visits to households to ensure compliance with the IFA's <a href="642-exclusive-political-satire-hits-a-new-high-as-gaming-influencer.html">gaming</a> milestones.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The IRS, seeing an opportunity to diversify its revenue streams, has declared that all in-game currency, collectible items, and rare loot will be subject to <a href="445-in-shocking-twist-congress-proposes-virtual-reality-tax-to-fund.html">taxation</a>. "We're just ensuring that everyone pays their fair share," said IRS Commissioner, Ms. Pixel Patterson. "If you're making virtual gold, we want our cut. And by our cut, I mean enough to fund a fleet of government-issued super yachts."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the streets, the response has been mixed. "I can't believe they're taxing my rare Pokémon cards," said Sarah Gamer, a passionate collector and part-time Twitch streamer. "But on the bright side, I might finally be able to afford college with all these new tax breaks for <a href="439-exclusive-united-states-takes-a-bold-step-into-the-future.html">gaming</a> scholarships."</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the nation braces for this new era of <a href="311-title-how-video-games-unveiled-a-historic-shift-in-political.html">gaming</a>-centric governance, one thing is clear: the world will never be the same. And for those who struggle to achieve the required <a href="192-exposed-how-a-gaming-platform-became-the-unlikely-battleground-for.html">gaming</a> levels, there's always the option to enlist in the newly formed "Gamer's Army," a specialized force of elite players who have vowed to protect the homeland from any and all invading aliens or rogue AI systems.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The future of America is in the hands of its gamers, and the only currency they will accept is in-game credits and unlimited continues. The quest for national <a href="187-exclusive-report-how-gaming-became-the-new-political-arena-in.html">gaming</a> supremacy has begun, and it's time for every American to level up.</p>
