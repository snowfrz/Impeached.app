                <p></p>
<p>In a move that has left the scientific community both scratching their heads and reaching for their calculators, <a href="73-breaking-president-under-fire-as-new-evidence-emerges-of-corruption.html">President</a> Quantum Calculus has proposed a groundbreaking new tax on quantum computing research. The proposal, which has been met with a mix of outrage and bewilderment, aims to "level the economic playing field" and ensure that "all citizens contribute to the incredible potential of quantum <a href="299-the-science-revolution-how-a-unified-front-of-democrats-is.html">science</a>."</p>
<p></p>
<p>According to insider sources, the <a href="353-exclusive-how-presidents-bold-disaster-response-is-redefining-political-strategy.html">President</a>'s rationale is twofold: firstly, to fund the ambitious infrastructure projects he promised during his campaign, and secondly, to prevent the "elitist hoarding of future technology" by taxing the elite scientists who are currently racing to unlock the mysteries of the quantum realm.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The proposed tax, which is yet to be legislated, would see a hefty tariff placed on the development of quantum processors, entanglers, and qubit-manipulators. Critics argue that this could stifle innovation, sending the burgeoning field of quantum <a href="121-breaking-supreme-court-ruling-paves-way-for-groundbreaking-science-that.html">science</a> back to the drawing board, or worse, to other countries willing to invest without the shackles of such stringent fiscal policies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Supporters of the <a href="356-exclusive-inside-look-at-the-secret-political-strategy-that-could.html">President</a>, however, hail the initiative as a bold step towards democratizing <a href="204-exclusive-supreme-courts-historic-decision-on-taxation-could-redefine-american.html">science</a>. They argue that by taxing quantum computing, the <a href="58-president-proposes-dystopian-government-legislation-to-limit-freedom-are-we.html">President</a> is ensuring that the benefits of this next evolution in technology will not be confined to the boardrooms of multinational corporations and ivory towers of academia. Instead, the tax revenue will, allegedly, be funneled into public works projects, such as the long-awaited reconstruction of the nation's dilapidated supercolliders and the reinvigoration of the space program, which has reportedly been struggling to find its footing since the last moon-bound mission was controversially derailed by a rogue asteroid.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The reaction from the scientific community has been a veritable spectrum of dismay, with leading quantum physicists warning that such a tax could "fundamentally alter the trajectory of human progress." Meanwhile, tax experts are speculating on the potential for black market quantum tech, where researchers might sell their innovations on the sly to avoid the <a href="222-exclusive-impeachment-showdown-looms-as-supreme-court-weighs-in-on.html">President</a>'s grasp.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a bizarre twist, the <a href="283-supreme-showdown-presidents-controversial-tax-plan-on-the-brink-as.html">President</a> has also suggested that the tax could be avoided by any scientist who can successfully predict the outcome of a quantum experiment with 100% accuracy. Critics of the plan have pointed out that such predictions are, by the very nature of quantum mechanics, impossible to make with absolute certainty. Yet, the <a href="148-explosive-controversy-erupts-over-presidents-radical-new-campaign-to-overhaul.html">President</a> remains undeterred, convinced that this added challenge will only serve to inspire a new generation of quantum prophets.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the nation braces for what could be a seismic shift in the world of <a href="272-elections-2020-how-mobile-gaming-apps-are-shaping-the-future.html">science</a> and technology, one thing is certain: the future has never been more uncertain. Or taxed.</p>
