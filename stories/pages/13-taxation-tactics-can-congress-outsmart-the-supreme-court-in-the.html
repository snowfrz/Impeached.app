<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, <a href="6-breaking-presidential-election-shocker---candidate-reveals-secret-war-agenda.html">Congress</a> has announced their latest strategy to outsmart the <a href="3-shocking-new-bill-proposes-to-make-president-for-life-will.html">Supreme Court</a> in the ongoing game of legal limbo. The latest tactic involves a clever reinterpretation of the <a href="1-constitutional-crisis-erupts-strategy-games-reveal-hidden-agenda-in-election.html">Constitution</a>, which they claim will allow them to tax the Court's entire budget without violating the separation of powers.</p>
<p>According to sources within Congress, the plan involves creating a new "Taxation Tactics" committee, led by none other than Speaker of the House, Representative John Q. Public. The committee will be tasked with devising creative ways to tax the Supreme Court's operations, including but not limited to:</p>
<p>* A "Tax on Taxes": a new tax on all taxes paid by the Court, which will be used to fund the committee's operations.</p>
<p>* A "Tax on Talking": a surcharge on any verbal communication between Justices, to discourage them from "chattering" excessively.</p>
<p>* A "Tax on Thinking": a levy on any mental activity engaged in by the Court, including but not limited to deep breathing exercises, meditation, and legal brief writing.</p>
<p>When asked for comment, Representative Public stated, "We're not trying to be vindictive or anything, but the Supreme Court has been getting a little too comfortable in their robes lately. It's time for them to get back in line and start playing by the rules."</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has yet to respond to the latest development, but sources close to the Court have indicated that they are "considering their options" and "exploring all available legal remedies".</p>
<p>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story, as Congress continues to push the boundaries of legal satire.</p>
