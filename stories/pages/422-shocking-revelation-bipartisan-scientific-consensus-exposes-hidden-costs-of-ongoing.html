                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Impeached 2 is an armchair politician's dream. <a

                <p></p>
<p>In a stunning turn of events, a bipartisan group of scientists from the prestigious Institute of Highly Obvious Discoveries (IHOD) has unveiled a groundbreaking study that has left the nation both bewildered and unsurprised. The study, titled "The Invisible Wallet: Quantifying the Economic Consequences of Our Fervent National Dissension," reveals that the never-ending conflict between the <a href="94-title-democrats-take-a-stand-proposing-an-amendment-to-the.html">Democrats</a> and the <a href="49-gop-leaders-secretly-hooked-on-mobile-games-ignore-national-disasters.html">Republicans</a> has been secretly draining American wallets at a rate that would make even Scrooge McDuck blush.</p>
<p></p>
<p>According to the study, the cost of Congressional gridlock extends far beyond the obvious legislative stalemates and government shutdowns. The IHOD researchers have calculated that the collective stress of bipartisan bickering has led to an alarming increase in the national consumption of comfort foods, particularly ice cream and craft beer. The <a href="248-exclusive-presidents-shocking-gaming-habit-raises-questions-in-congress.html">House of Representatives</a>' insistence on ideological purity has apparently created a demand for 34% more artisanal pickles, a figure that pickle economists are calling "briny and startling."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Moreover, the study suggests that the ongoing <a href="241-exclusive-behind-the-scenes-of-the-political-chess-game-that.html">war</a> of words has led to a significant uptick in the global market for noise-cancelling headphones, as Americans from all walks of life seek refuge from the relentless political din. The report estimates that if the noise-cancelling headphone industry were a country, it would be the 47th largest economy in the world, narrowly surpassing Qatar.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But the most shocking finding? The IHOD researchers have discovered that the constant state of partisan hostility has actually accelerated the aging process in American citizens, leading to a surge in the sales of anti-aging products. The report estimates that if this trend continues, the beauty and personal care industry will soon be the only thing growing at a rate faster than the national debt.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a rare display of unity, both parties have acknowledged the findings and have promised to work together to address these hidden costs. However, the exact nature of their proposed solutions remains shrouded in the same veil of mystery that has enveloped the source of the conflict in the first place.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the nation grapples with these revelations, one thing is clear: the next time you reach for that $10 artisanal pickle or splurge on a pair of top-of-the-line noise-cancelling headphones, remember to cast a wistful glance <a href="200-unprecedented-victory-for-online-gaming-supreme-court-rules-in-favor.html">war</a>ards the hallowed halls of the <a href="186-united-states-faces-unprecedented-disaster-as-futurist-campaign-shakes-up.html">House of Representatives</a>, where the real costs of <a href="330-exclusive-how-the-impeached-presidents-political-games-changed-the-course.html">war</a> are being quietly calculated in dollars and Pickles of Peace.</p>
