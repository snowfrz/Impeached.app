<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the Democratic Party has announced a groundbreaking new proposal to prepare for an intergalactic <a href="6-breaking-presidential-election-shocker---candidate-reveals-secret-war-agenda.html">war</a>. According to sources, the new <a href="22-dystopian-constitution-crisis-threatens-to-upend-election.html">Constitution</a>, titled "The Cosmic Charter," promises to be a "visionary" and <a href="16-breaking-war-over-supreme-court-election-threatens-to-erode-freedom.html">war</a>rward-thinking" document that will "usher in a new era of galactic cooperation and peace."</p>
<p>The document, which is said to be over 100 pages long, includes provisions for the establishment of a Galactic <a href="2-impeached-senator-caught-in-taxation-trouble-new-scandal-rocks-capitol.html">Senate</a>, the creation of a Galactic Army, and the establishment of a Galactic Central Bank.</p>
<p>"We are living in a time of great uncertainty," said Speaker of the House, Representative Zara "Z-Star" Patel. "As we look to the future, it is clear that our planet must become a member of the intergalactic community. The Cosmic Charter is the blueprint for this new era of galactic cooperation and peace."</p>
<p>But not everyone is convinced. Critics of the new <a href="42-dystopian-future-looms-as-republicans-secretly-amend-constitution-to-grant.html">Constitution</a> have pointed out that it includes provisions for the establishment of a "Galactic Police Force," which some see as a potential threat to individual liberties.</p>
<p>"I cannot support a document that would give the government so much power over our lives," said Senator John "J-Rock" Rodriguez. "We must ensure that the rights of the citizens are protected and that the government does not become a tool of the intergalactic elite."</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, the Democratic Party remains optimistic about the future of the new <a href="1-constitutional-crisis-erupts-strategy-games-reveal-hidden-agenda-in-election.html">Constitution</a>.</p>
<p>"We are living in a time of great change," said President of the United States, Representative Alex "A-Wave" Wilson. "The Cosmic Charter is the key to unlocking a brighter future for all of humanity. We must embrace this visionary document and join the intergalactic community."</p>
<p>The Cosmic Charter is expected to be put to a vote in the near future. If passed, it will go into effect immediately, marking a new era in human history.</p>
