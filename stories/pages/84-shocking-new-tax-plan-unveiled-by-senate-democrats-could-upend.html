<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, <a href="33-shocking-twist-in-impeachment-battle-political-strategists-turn-to-strategy.html">Senate</a> <a href="74-breaking-democrats-unveil-new-constitution-to-prepare-for-intergalactic-war.html">Democrats</a> have unveiled a new tax plan that could potentially upend the entire US economy. The plan, which is expected to be voted on in the coming weeks, aims to simplify the tax code by consolidating multiple tax brackets into a single, super-bracket.</p>
<p>"This is a game-changer," said <a href="17-shocking-new-evidence-uncovers-decades-old-corruption-scheme-in-senate-leading.html">Senate</a> Majority Leader, Chuck Schumer (D-NY). "By collapsing the entire tax code into a single, easy-to-understand bracket, we can finally make taxes simple and fair for everyone."</p>
<p>However, experts are warning that the plan could have unintended consequences. "If this passes, it could lead to a complete overhaul of the US economy," said Dr. Emily Johnson, a tax expert at the Brookings Institution. "We could see a surge in entrepreneurship and innovation, but also a potential crash in the stock market."</p>
<p>The plan, which has been dubbed the "Simplification and Fairness Tax Act" (SAFTA), would reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to one, with a top rate of 40%. The new bracket would apply to all income above $50,000, and would be phased in gradually over the next decade.</p>
<p>But not everyone is convinced. "This is just a thinly-veiled attempt to redistribute wealth from the rich to the poor," said Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX). "It's a classic example of socialism, and it will lead to economic disaster."</p>
<p>Despite the criticism, the plan has gained widespread support among <a href="42-dystopian-future-looms-as-republicans-secretly-amend-constitution-to-grant.html">Democrats</a>, who see it as a way to address income inequality and simplify the tax code. "We're not trying to punish the wealthy," said Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT). "We're just trying to make sure that everyone has a fair shot at success."</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, one thing is certain: the fate of the US economy hangs in the balance. Will SAFTA pass, or will it be struck down by a coalition of Republican lawmakers and wealthy donors? Only time will tell. Stay tuned!</p>
