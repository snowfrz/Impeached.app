<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, a new piece of <a href="39-impeached-democrats-unveil-groundbreaking-science-based-political-strategy-to-rewrite-legislation.html">legislation</a> has been proposed in the Dystopian government, threatening the long-held right of mobile gamers to unlimited in-app purchases.</p>
<p>According to sources, the new bill, known as the "In-App Purchase Limitation and Regulation Act," seeks to impose strict limits on the amount of money that can be spent on in-game items and features.</p>
<p>"This is a direct attack on our freedom," said Gamer X, a long-time advocate for the rights of mobile gamers. "We have a fundamental right to spend as much money as we want on in-app purchases without any interference from the government."</p>
<p>The proposed <a href="25-supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-election-altering-legislation-science-community.html">legislation</a> has sparked widespread outrage among mobile gamers, who are accustomed to indulging in unlimited in-app purchases without any financial constraints.</p>
<p>"It's like they're trying to take away our right to indulge in virtual shopping sprees," said Gamer Y. "We should be able to buy as many power-ups, weapons, and digital collectibles as we want, without any interference from the government."</p>
<p>The proposed <a href="20-breaking-new-legislation-threatens-to-unleash-intergalactic-war-expert-warns.html">legislation</a> has been met with fierce opposition from the mobile gaming industry, which sees it as a threat to their bottom line.</p>
<p>"This <a href="58-president-proposes-dystopian-government-legislation-to-limit-freedom-are-we.html">legislation</a> will have a devastating impact on our industry," said a spokesperson for a major mobile game developer. "If the government starts regulating in-app purchases, it will be a disaster for our business model."</p>
<p>Despite the backlash, supporters of the <a href="26-supreme-court-rules-strategy-games-now-legal-in-all-50.html">legislation</a> argue that it is necessary to protect vulnerable populations from the predatory practices of mobile game developers.</p>
<p>"In-app purchases can be incredibly addictive and financially draining," said Representative Z, the lead sponsor of the bill. "We need to protect our citizens from the exploitative tactics of these companies, and ensure that they are not taken advantage of by unscrupulous developers."</p>
<p>The proposed <a href="42-dystopian-future-looms-as-republicans-secretly-amend-constitution-to-grant.html">legislation</a> has yet to be voted on, but if passed, it could have far-reaching implications for the mobile gaming industry and the freedom of mobile gamers to indulge in their favorite pastime.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story. In the meantime, it's time to stock up on those in-game purchases, just in case.</p>
