<p>In an unprecedented turn of events, the <a href="431-exclusive-supreme-courts-landmark-decision-on-taxation-could-reshape-the.html">Supreme Court</a>, in a landmark ruling, has declared that all historical artifacts, from the dawn of civilization to the founding of the United States, are now exempt from <a href="1021-exclusive-supreme-courts-shocking-decision-on-presidents-controversial-tax-plan.html">taxation</a>. The ruling, which has sent shockwaves through the financial world, stems from a peculiar case involving an antiquities collector named Alexander Timebar.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Timebar, a passionate enthusiast of ancient relics, had amassed a collection so vast it rivaled the Smithsonian. However, his collection was under threat from the IRS, who claimed that his artifacts, despite their historical significance, were liable for back taxes dating back to the era of the Pharaohs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The case caught the attention of the <a href="1188-exclusive-the-science-whiz-kid-who-shocked-the-senate-with.html">President</a>, a charismatic leader known for his outlandish tweets and even more outlandish policies. Seeing an opportunity to garner support from the historical preservation community, the <a href="1277-exclusive-house-vote-on-controversial-new-tax-law-flips-after.html">President</a> threw his weight behind Timebar, advocating for the tax-exempt status of all ancient artifacts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <a href="1707-exclusive-as-impeached-leader-faces-supreme-court-showdown-science-community.html">Supreme Court</a>, in a surprisingly unanimous decision, sided with the <a href="1624-exclusive-congress-erupts-into-chaos-as-republicans-challenge-presidents-constitutional.html">President</a>, declaring that since these items predate the American <a href="963-exclusive-the-unseen-political-chess-game-threatening-the-foundations-of.html">Constitution</a>, they are inherently exempt from <a href="150-scandal-rocks-capitol-hill-congress-proposes-controversial-tax-hike-on.html">taxation</a>. Justice Historic, writing for the majority, argued that "to tax the past is to tax the very essence of our nation's founding principles. It is akin to taxing the ink on the parchment upon which the <a href="1409-exclusive-how-a-shadowy-network-of-politicians-and-lobbyists-is.html">Constitution</a> was written."</p>
<p></p>
<p>The ruling has since sparked a nationwide debate on the interpretation of the <a href="1995-title-revolutionary-science-breakthrough-threatens-the-very-fabric-of-our.html">Constitution</a>, with some historians arguing that this could potentially nullify all taxes on pre-1789 items, including the famed Liberty Bell, which is now rumored to be planning a grand tour of the world, free from the shackles of <a href="1666-exclusive-how-the-presidents-latest-political-games-could-lead-to.html">taxation</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The impact of this decision is immeasurable. Economists predict a surge in the importation of ancient treasures, while others worry about the potential loss of national heritage. Meanwhile, the IRS is reportedly considering a rebranding campaign, with slogans like "IRS: We don't tax <a href="527-unveiled-the-mobile-game-thats-quietly-shaping-political-strategy-and.html">history</a>, only the present and the future."</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the dust settles on this historic decision, one thing is clear: the American way of life will never be the same since the dawn of time. And as for Alexander Timebar, he is rumored to be planning a grand exhibition of his collection, promising "the event of the century, where <a href="551-supreme-showdown-how-a-strategy-game-prodigy-uncovered-a-dystopian.html">history</a> itself will be on display, absolutely free of charge."</p>
