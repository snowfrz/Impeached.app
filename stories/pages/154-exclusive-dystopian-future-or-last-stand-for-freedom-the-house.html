<p>In a move that has left political analysts scratching their heads and <a href="124-title-how-science-may-rewrite-the-rules-of-political-strategy.html">dystopian</a> fiction authors nodding in agreement, the <a href="97-unveiled-the-shocking-truth-behind-how-freedom-and-political-maneuvering.html">House of Representatives</a> has officially voted to impeach President Bizarro for "undermining the very fabric of our society." The vote, which took place under the dim glow of what many are calling "the ominous orange sky of 2023," saw a majority of representatives from both parties unite in a display of bipartisanship that would make Charles Dickens weep into his bowl of porridge.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The resolution, H.R. Unprecedented-2023, accuses President Bizarro of engaging in a series of actions that "threaten the very essence of liberty and democracy." Among these charges are claims that the President has been secretly harvesting corn for use in ethanol, a move that has been described as a "direct assault on the corn-based diet that is the cornerstone of American culture."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Furthermore, President Bizarro has been reported to have uttered the phrase "Let them eat cake," a clear slap in the face to the sacred American tradition of eating corn-based products at every meal. His administration has also been accused of attempting to replace the national anthem with a tune played by bagpipes, a maneuver that, if successful, would undoubtedly lead to a society-wide outbreak of "The Scotsman's Caledonia" dance craze.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Supporters of the impeachment argue that this is the last stand for <a href="63-impeached-politicians-use-taxation-to-fight-for-freedom-a-sho.html">freedom</a>, a chance to prevent the descent into a <a href="128-title-when-the-levees-break-how-government-neglect-led-to.html">dystopian</a> nightmare where Americans might be expected to converse without using corn references, or worst of all, consume a meal without a side of corn. Meanwhile, critics of the impeachment claim that this is nothing more than a political circus, a distraction from the real issues at hand, such as the pressing need for a national corn surplus.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the nation braces for the potential fallout from this unprecedented political event, one thing is clear: the future of the republic hangs in the balance, and the only thing more certain than taxes is the fact that there will be more hot takes on social media than there are ears of corn at the local state fair. Stay tuned as this story develops, unless it all turns out to be a bad dream brought on by eating too much corn-based popcorn at the movies.</p>
