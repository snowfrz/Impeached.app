                <p></p>
<p>In an unprecedented turn of events, the United States Congress has been thrown into turmoil after a marathon session of "Risk: The Capitol Edition," a strategy game that has inexplicably become the latest legislative inspiration. Sources close to the game night, which reportedly included members from both the House of Representatives and the Senate, reveal that the game's theme of global domination and strategic alliances had a profound impact on the lawmakers' perspectives on executive power and <a href="46-breaking-democrats-unveil-revolutionary-new-mobile-game-to-win-back.html">impeachment</a> proceedings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The culmination of this high-stakes game night has led to the introduction of the "So Very Not A Game Act" (SVNGA), a proposed <a href="67-revealed-secret-plan-to-gut-constitution-and-hand-over-power.html">Constitution</a>al amendment that seeks to prevent any future elected executive from facing the indignity of <a href="73-breaking-president-under-fire-as-new-evidence-emerges-of-corruption.html">impeachment</a>. The bill, championed by the unlikely bipartisan duo of Representatives Cheeseburger (R-Texas) and Fondue Fontana (D-Vermont), argues that the <a href="33-shocking-twist-in-impeachment-battle-political-strategists-turn-to-strategy.html">impeachment</a> process is akin to a game of chance, where the outcomes are too unpredictable and the consequences too severe to allow anyone to endure such a fate twice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The SVNGA, which has already garnered the support of several key figures who identify as "Game of Thrones" fans, posits that if an executive, previously <a href="43-impeached-again-shocking-new-developments-in-washington-shake-up-political.html">impeached</a>, is to be reelected, they should be granted immunity from <a href="2-impeached-senator-caught-in-taxation-trouble-new-scandal-rocks-capitol.html">impeachment</a> for the duration of their subsequent term. This bold move, according to the bill's proponents, will prevent the political equivalent of "revenge of the eliminated," ensuring that a duly elected official can govern without the specter of <a href="19-shocking-supreme-court-ruling-threatens-presidents-impeachment-will-he-survive.html">impeachment</a> hanging over their head like the Sword of Damocles, which, incidentally, they lost in a game of "Twister" during a previous team-building exercise.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Critics of the SVNGA have denounced the proposal as a brazen attempt to undermine the <a href="54-shocking-new-evidence-reveals-constitutional-crisis-imminent-congress-plots-to.html">Constitution</a>'s system of checks and balances, likening it to allowing a player who has been caught cheating in "Monopoly" to keep their ill-gotten properties. Legal experts have warned that such an amendment could set a dangerous precedent, potentially leading to a political landscape where no elected official is ever truly accountable for their actions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Despite the controversy, the SVNGA is gaining momentum among those who believe that the <a href="70-revealed-the-shocking-truth-about-republicans-and-taxation---will.html">impeachment</a> process is akin to a "balance wheel" in a slot machine, offering random results and little assurance of justice. With the support of the newly formed "Congressional Gaming Caucus," which counts among its members individuals who have a proven track record of treating their legislative duties with the same gravity as a game of "Battleship," the SVNGA is poised to disrupt the political landscape in ways that even the most predictive algorithms couldn't foresee.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the nation watches with bated breath, the SVNGA is set to be the most talked-about legislative initiative since the "National Planking Day Resolution" of 2019. Whether it will be a masterstroke of legislative strategy or a misstep that will send the political board game into chaos remains to be seen. One thing is certain: the political equivalent of "all your base are belong to us" has never been more relevant.</p>
