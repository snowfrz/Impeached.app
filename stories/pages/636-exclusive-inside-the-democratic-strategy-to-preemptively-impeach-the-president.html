                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Impeached 2 is an armchair politician's dream. <a

                <p></p>
<p>In a startling revelation that has sent shockwaves through the political landscape, sources close to the Democratic Party have leaked a dossier detailing a top-secret strategy to impeach the sitting <a href="325-supreme-courts-stunning-move-to-reshape-american-politics-a-strategy.html">President</a> before he even has the chance to commit any impeachable offenses in the present.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The plan, codenamed "The Time-Traveling Tribunal," allegedly involves a clandestine group of political savants who have developed a sophisticated algorithm capable of predicting and analyzing potential <a href="557-unveiled-the-presidents-secret-strategy-game-that-changed-the-course.html">war</a> crimes the <a href="465-exclusive-how-the-presidents-obsession-with-mobile-games-is-upending.html">President</a> might commit in the yet-to-be-realized future.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The algorithm, which sources have referred to as the "Temporal Tempora," has been described as a "future-proof" machine learning tool that monitors the <a href="509-senate-erupts-in-drama-as-impeached-president-fights-for-supreme.html">President</a>'s public statements, social media activity, and even dreams reported by his inner circle. The tool then cross-references this data against a database of international treaties, historical precedents, and science fiction literature to pinpoint moments where the <a href="222-exclusive-impeachment-showdown-looms-as-supreme-court-weighs-in-on.html">President</a> could potentially overstep his legal and moral bounds.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <a href="155-exclusive-how-gaming-cultures-inside-jokes-could-influence-the-upcoming.html">Democrats</a>, led by the enigmatic "Chair of Tomorrow," Congressperson Prognostica, are said to be preparing a series of <a href="68-impeachment-shocker-congress-votes-to-tax-gaming-industry-to-fund.html">impeachment</a> articles that accuse the <a href="163-watch-as-disaster-strikes-will-the-house-of-representatives-override.html">President</a> of crimes he has yet to commit. These alleged offenses include the use of experimental weaponry in foreign conflicts that, according to the Temporal Tempora, would inadvertently cause butterfly effects leading to catastrophic global events.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One insider, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of being assigned to a committee on interdimensional affairs, revealed that the <a href="343-exclusive-democrats-unveil-innovative-strategy-game-to-explain-impeachment-process.html">Democrats</a> have already drafted a resolution that calls for the establishment of a "War Crimes Prevention Task Force," a body empowered to preemptively apprehend any individual displaying a propensity for future malfeasance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Critics have denounced the move as the epitome of political overreach, accusing the <a href="147-exclusive-democrats-and-republicans-engage-in-high-stakes-political-chess-match.html">Democrats</a> of trying to legislate time itself. "It's one thing to impeach someone for what they've done; it's another to impeach them for what they might do, especially if it hasn't happened yet," said Senator Foresight, a member of the opposition party known for his short-sightedness and love for anachronistic technology.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="501-exclusive-how-taxation-tactics-are-becoming-the-new-political-satire.html">President</a> himself has issued a statement, declaring the Democratic strategy as nothing more than a "baseless temporal temper tantrum." He promised to "continue leading America into a prosperous future, one where we focus on the present and leave the worrying about the past and the future to the soothsayers and the historians."</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the nation grapples with the possibility of impeaching a man before he's even had the chance to take office in the current timeline, one thing is clear: the line between science fiction and political strategy is blurring in ways that even H.G. Wells could have never predicted.</p>
