<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="2-impeached-senator-caught-in-taxation-trouble-new-scandal-rocks-capitol.html">impeached</a> President, John Smith, has been found guilty of treason in a strategy game dystopia. The game, known as "Game of Thrones: The Rise of the Republic," allows players to assume the role of a political leader in a futuristic <a href="42-dystopian-future-looms-as-republicans-secretly-amend-constitution-to-grant.html">dystopian</a> society.</p>
<p>According to sources, President Smith was caught red-handed, literally, as he was plotting to overthrow the government of the United States of America. The evidence against him was overwhelming, with witnesses testifying to his nefarious schemes.</p>
<p>"It's not every day that we get to see a real-life political leader brought to justice in a strategy game," said a spokesperson for the game's developer. "We are pleased to see that President Smith's actions have consequences, even in a virtual world."</p>
<p>The game's rules of procedure were instrumental in securing President Smith's conviction. The game's governing body, <a href="73-breaking-president-under-fire-as-new-evidence-emerges-of-corruption.html">Congress</a>, was able to use the rules to strip President Smith of his powers and impose a treason charge.</p>
<p>"It's not every day that we get to see a political leader held accountable for their actions," said a representative of <a href="54-shocking-new-evidence-reveals-constitutional-crisis-imminent-congress-plots-to.html">Congress</a>. "We hope that this conviction will serve as a deterrent to any other leaders who might be tempted to engage in such heinous crimes."</p>
<p>President Smith's lawyers have released a statement denying any wrongdoing, claiming that the evidence against their client is circumstantial at best. However, the game's developer and <a href="68-impeachment-shocker-congress-votes-to-tax-gaming-industry-to-fund.html">Congress</a> have rejected these claims, stating that the evidence is irrefutable.</p>
<p>As a result of his conviction, President Smith has been banished from the game and stripped of all political power. It remains to be seen how this will impact his real-life political career.</p>
<p>In a separate but related development, a spokesperson for the game has announced that a new update will be released soon, featuring a new playable leader, a rebel warlord known as "Cersai Lannister." Fans of the game have expressed excitement at the prospect of playing as the ruthless and cunning leader, known for her unwavering ambition and willingness to do whatever it takes to achieve her goals.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the trial of President Smith serves as a reminder that even in a virtual world, political leaders must be held accountable for their actions. As the game's developer and <a href="6-breaking-presidential-election-shocker---candidate-reveals-secret-war-agenda.html">Congress</a> continue to enforce the rules of procedure, it remains to be seen how this will impact the political landscape of the United States of America.</p>
